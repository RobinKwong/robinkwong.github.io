  description: Rhetorical scrolling is the technique of using scrolling to help readers better grasp large numbers. The xkcd example works well because the large number (length of time since 20,000BC) is used as contrast to make a point about how fast temperature has risen recently. The BBC example works less well for two reasons. There's no corresponding point being made, and the scale varies so scrolling actually distorts the reader's understanding of the large number (i.e. distance to the centre of the earth)
