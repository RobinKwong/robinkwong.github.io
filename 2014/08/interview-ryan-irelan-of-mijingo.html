Can you please take a few moments and introduce yourself and share what your day to day may look like.</h3>

<p>Hi, there. I’m Ryan and I create courses for web designers and developers to get more from their tools. I do that through Mijingo.com, my little training hub.</p>

<p>My days are a mix between course research and production, talking to customers who send in support emails, marketing, and business admin stuff. I’m also doing a bit of video production consulting work. I’m really, really excited about what I’m working on.</p>

<p>Six weeks ago I left my position as VP of Technology at Happy Cog to run Mijingo full-time. That means I’m still figuring out my days as I go.</p>

<h3 id="you-recently-went-full-time-on-mijingo-seems-like-you-share-a-lot-of-varying-content-from-cms-specific-tutorials-to-budgeting-techniques-where-do-you-learn-all-of-the-information-you-are-teaching-is-there-a-certain-place-you-go-to-learn-or-is-it-mostly-experience-you-picked-up-working-at-happy-cog">You recently went full time on Mijingo. Seems like you share a lot of varying content from CMS specific tutorials to budgeting techniques. Where do you learn all of the information you are teaching. Is there a certain place you go to learn or is it mostly experience you picked up working at Happy Cog?</h3>

<p>It’s comes from three places: experience from working in the industry, personal interest in tools, and old fashioned research. All courses have a research component (in the form of a lengthy Markdown-formatted outline) but some are more heavily researched than others because of my personal knowledge of the topic.</p>

<p>While researching I look everywhere for information–and I always look several places for the same answer. As you know, the internet is full of incorrect information so solid research requires a few sources to confirm a fact. This is usually something small like the history behind a technology or how people describe a piece of what I’m teaching.</p>

<h3 id="someones-just-starting-getting-into-web-development-where-would-you-direct-to-get-started-them-besides-mijingo-and-what-advice-might-you-suggest">Someones just starting getting into web development. Where would you direct to get started them besides Mijingo and what advice might you suggest.</h3>

<p>Have a project to build. No one can learn well without a way to apply the information they’re reading or watching. I know some people say they’re theoretical learners and others are applied learners but the fact is everyone is an applied learner. Even in theoretical disciplines you’re still applying that information to problems.</p>

<p>Learning web development is the same thing. Find a problem (or create one) to solve and then use the tool you want to learn to solve it. If you want to learn Laravel (on my personal learning list), redo your site in it, or create a fun, simple web app to build with it. Just playing with it isn’t enough. There’s a reason you always learn the most about your tools while building actual projects.</p>

<p>In short (for those skimming): learning wants to be applied.</p>

<h3 id="that-same-person-is-setting-up-a-website-to-get-there-name-out-there-probably-houses-a-landing-page-work-section-and-a-blog-is-a-flat-file-cms-the-way-to-go-or-is-something-like-craft-or-wordpress-a-better-foundation-to-start-on">That same person is setting up a website to get there name out there. Probably houses a landing page, work section and a blog. Is a flat file CMS the way to go or is something like Craft or Wordpress a better foundation to start on?</h3>

<p>Static files with no CMS or generator behind it. Don’t make tools a hurdle. Throw them to the side until you need them. Pick the easiest path to getting your site up and then iterate from there. That’s a lesson for any project, really. Build it in a way that you can get it working, then figure out how to make it better.</p>

<p>If you need to get a website up, do it the best way you can right now. If that’s static HTML and CSS then use that. No one will care or know.</p>

<p>I regularly find myself saying “Oh I just need to build it in [new tech] and then I can launch this thing.” Right after I smack myself in the face I start finding the path of least resistance to get whatever it is done. Hosted e-commerce instead of self-hosted? Do it. You want sales, not pride.</p>

<p>When I launched my first screencast site (eescreencasts.com, no longer live), I built the whole thing as a custom CMS on CodeIgniter. I didn’t need it and I shouldn’t have spent the time doing it. It was a nightmare to maintain because I only coded the absolute basics. It was a waste of effort when I could’ve been focused on something more useful to me.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-question-i-always-find-prevalent-to-ask-the-web-development-industry-is-moving-so-fast-any-suggestions-on-staying-on-top-of-it-or-knowing-when-to-not-go-down-another-rabbit-hole">This is a question I always find prevalent to ask. The web development industry is moving so fast, any suggestions on staying on top of it or knowing when to not go down another rabbit hole?</h3>

<p>It’s a constant battle to feather the gas and the brake. You have to remain curious and aware of how your industry and practice area is changing. But you probably don’t want to–and can’t–chase every tool that comes out. Knowing about it is enough. Experiment just enough to be able to make an educated decision about the tool if it is a project requirement or option in the future.</p>

<p>I like to follow a lot of sites via RSS feeds as a way to keep an eye on the pulse of the web development technology. Things are changing so fast but a lot of it is noise. It feels faster than it is.</p>

<h3 id="lastly-any-sites-that-you-have-seen-lately-that-are-really-inspiring-you">Lastly, any sites that you have seen lately that are really inspiring you?</h3>

<p>Oh, hmm. My recent weeks have been heads down in stuff like accounting software and email tools. But I really like Vellum from the NY Times R&amp;D team. It’s tagline is “A reading layer for your Twitter feed” and it pulls together links shared in your feed.</p>

<p>I’m always inspired by the tools that the nerds at ProPublica are building. They are doing good work and making otherwise unapproachable data sets interactive and digestible. I have a tech crush on that entire team.</p>
