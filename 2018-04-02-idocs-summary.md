I had a great time and learnt a lot from the [iDocs 2018](https://idocs2018.dcrc.org.uk/) conference in Bristol.

My full conference notes are here: [day 1](/idocs-day-1/), [day 2](/idocs-day-2/) and [day 3](/idocs-day-3/), and here are the [slides and words](/new-audiences/) of the talk I gave about interacting with new audiences. 

But if I were to summarise the experience, I would say that I came away with two overriding thoughts. The first is the cornucopia of interesting and influential projects that I simply did not know (this is one of the great benefits of going to a conference outside of your field or area of expertise). The second is that many disciplines all have to work through similar problems, and have debates on similar problems: I'm more convinced than ever that there are lots that journalists, ethnographers, documentarians, game designer and technologists can learn from each other.

## Projects galore!
