When I tell people I will be going on sabbatical for much of November and December, the first question is invariably: "So, what are you going to do?"

I've mostly just been saying "nothing", or "I'll just rest and relax", or "maybe I'll do some travelling. I don't know yet"

But, to be honest, I *do* know what I want to do. I've just been too embarassed to admit it. But hey, people probably already think I'm weird and/or a nerd, so here it is. A(n evolving) list of the things I'm actually looking forward to doing during my sabbatical. 

- Read [Jonne Arjoranta](https://twitter.com/jaranta)'s academic paper on the [hermaneutic challenge in King of Dragon Pass](http://www.academia.edu/27610983/What_Does_it_Mean_to_be_Orlanthi_Hermeneutic_Challenge_in_King_of_Dragon_Pass). In fact, read all of his [papers](http://jyu.academia.edu/JonneArjoranta)
- Finish listening to every single [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/) podcast episode. Yes, all 260 of them.
- Play Civ 6. For the *entire* time
- Take this [Introduction to Complexity](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/59-introduction-to-complexity-fall-2016) mooc
- Read Drucker's *Managing for Results* and *Managing in Turbulent Times*  
- Finish reading the last 292 pages of Neal Stephenson's *Seveneves* (which I have only just realised is a palindrome)
- Finish watching season 2 of Chef's Table
- Watch Mr Robot (both seasons)
- Go birdwatching at Sevenoaks nature reserve
- Finish walking the [London Loop](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/loop-walk). We've done up to section 11 (out of 23)
- Write posts, on here
