I spoke to Lucinda Southern, a reporter at Digiday, [for an interview](http://digiday.com/publishers/financial-times-special-projects/) about my job as I approach the end of my first year as Special Projects Editor at the Financial Times.

In particular, I spoke about how a lot of my projects are experiments that don't necessarily lead to a permanent product. Instead, they're to help reporters realise their more innovative ideas: stories they've always want to do but don’t really fit anywhere, so it's hard for the reporter to find anyone to help them with it. 

In short, my job is about empowering editors and reporters to do better ‘deep’ journalism. In 2017 I hope to keep doing that by inspiring others to push the boundaries of digital storytelling, by helping make project planning routine at the FT, and by deepening collaboration between the newsroom and other parts of the FT.

I'm also going to be talking more about what I do at the [Newsrewired digital journalism conference](https://www.newsrewired.com/2017/01/16/more-speakers-join-live-social-video-and-special-projects-sessions/) in London on February 8
