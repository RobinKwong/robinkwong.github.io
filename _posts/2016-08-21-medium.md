My writing is not on Medium. I built this website using a heavily-modified Jekyll template and am hosting it on Github pages. There are no analytics or tracking cookies. 

This set of choices is by no means the most obvious or sensible for someone who wants to start writing publicly on the web in 2016. For most people, Medium would probably be their first choice. Other alternatives include Wordpress, Tumblr, posting directly on LinkedIn or Facebook, or using a service like Squarespace or Wix to build their site.

I considered all of those options, and chose none of them in the end. Some of the reasons for that are personal &mdash; they have to do with what I wanted this blog to be for. But others, I would argue, are common questions that any independent content producer should be asking themselves in an age of increasingly powerful web platforms. I hope that laying out my own reasoning will clarify why these are important considerations.  

## What's the site for?

For you, dear reader, I'm hoping this is a space to find out more about who I am, what I do professionally, and the thinking behind my views on some journalism and digital media issues. 

You might have an interest in the possibilities that exist at the crossroads of journalism and technology, and have come here to find inspiration. Or, at least, a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for someone who works in this area. You might even come here to be entertained. 

For me, this blog is a space for rumination. It is my calling card; an extended *curriculum vitae*. It tells the world what I stand for and what interests me professionally, and allows me to use as much (or as little) space as I need to explain my thoughts and ideas.

It is also a bridge connecting me back to the work I did and the skills I learnt while on the FT's interactive desk. It is where: 

- I could practice (and make mistakes) freely
- I would be reminded of what it means to be fiddling around with code and figuring out solutions
- I would have to make meaningful design chocies on something that matters deeply to me, and
- I would not have a professional developer or designer to fall back on

## Ok, so what does that mean?  

Establishing what I wanted this site to be for allowed me to answer a bunch of subsidiary questions that translated what the goals I wanted to achieve with this site, into actual decisions about how and where to publish my writing.

### How much does reach matter to me?
Not a lot. I would of course prefer to have more readers rather than fewer, but I also have inward-facing reasons for starting this blog that can be satisfied even if I have no readers at all. 

I am also aware that my writing addresses an audience with very particular interests: digital journalism/news nerds, and those interested organisational change. I therefore care much more about specifically reaching those people than getting a bigger overall audience. 

*This means that the main selling point of most platforms (magnifying your reach) is somewhat attractive to me, but is by no means a slam-dunk reason for joining it*

### What investment am I prepared to make?
I was prepared to put in a significant initial effort to explore my options, determine my best choice, formulate a plan, and to set up the site. But after that, I wanted posting new content to be easy and maintenance to be very low, because I wanted the bulk of my ongoing time investment to be spent on writing.

*This basically runs counter to the value proposition of most platforms and services, which is that they make it really easy for you to just start posting, without having to think very hard about why you are doing it and what that implies in terms of making your own design choices.* 

### If I collect analytics data, what am I actually going to do it?
Obviously depends on the data, but if we're talking about the basics that I could get through Google Analytics (pageviews, uniques, bounce rate, time on page), then: not a lot, if I'm being honest. 

There are several reasons for this:

- None of those metrics are good enough proxies for the two things I care about: Is my writing being read by my intended audience? What did they think about it?
- I have no contextual information to make sense of the numbers:
	- My sample size is too small for me to draw a meaningful baseline;
	- My posts are too non-fungible. (Of course reader behaviour on [this](http://www.robinkwong.com/self-help/) is going to be different from [this](http://www.robinkwong.com/history/))
	- Even if I observe an outlier or a trend, there could be multiple unknown reasons behind its existence.   

*This is why I don't use any tracking or collect analytics. To be precise, the reason is not that analytics data don't produce any benefits for me. It is that collecting it causes active harm by taking me further away from my goal. It goes against my desire to spend the bulk of any ongoing time commitment on writing. I also know that, if I collect the data, it would be impossible for me not to seek out meaningless patterns in the data, or to chase that hit of dopamine that comes from seeing the pageview counter tick upwards. That makes it harder for me to focus on writing well.*

*As Peter Drucker said:*

> What gets measured gets managed, even when it's pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose of the organisation to do so. 

### How much does freedom of choice and customisation matter to me?
A lot. This is as much about [expressing my self identity](https://design.blog/2016/08/17/alice-rawsthorn-on-design-and-choice/) and conveying what is unique and different about me, as it is about transferring information to the reader.

*Similar to the above question. This really forms the core of my philosophical objections to Medium: That it is a homogenising force in web publishing. In this, I am very heavily influenced by Matthew Butterick, who lays out the full argument in [The Billionaire's Typewriter](http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html "The Billionaire's Typewriter")* 

### How much does ownership and control over the material matter to me? 
Quite a lot. I'm spending time and using my expertise and experience to write these posts. The site, as a whole, is a tangible expression of my intangible assets (skills and knowledge I spent time and effort acquiring). I therefore ascribe value to them and believe that my ownership and ability to exercise control over them matter a lot, even if I have no plans to make money directly from them. I may be giving them to the world for free, but it is important that I can freely choose to give them away.   

*Choice of presentation is just one form of control you give up when you write on a platform. In order for the platform to optimise distribution it must also restrict your control over how your writing is distributed. Facebook, in particular, optimises distribution based on criteria it deems important to viewers, rather than what's important to the writer. This may be good systems design for a personalised social media network, but it could have [political]((http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/20/0900.html "Anywhere but Medium")) [ramifications](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/). It certainly [has](https://twitter.com/stuntbox/status/769198539662618624) [journalistic](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/facebook_and_media.php) [implications](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/magazine/inside-facebooks-totally-insane-unintentionally-gigantic-hyperpartisan-political-media-machine.html?_r=0).*    

### Can I separate where my work resides from how people would discover it?

Yes, if I create my own website. Not as much, if I am publishing on Medium, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Those platforms all bundle together distribution and presentation &mdash; two distinct functions. I see no reason to rely on a single solution for both, when I can likely do better finding ways to achieve my goals by tackling the two problems separately.

*I use Github pages and Jekyll templates to only host and present my posts, with no expectation that either would help me distribute my work. Instead, I use a mix of other methods to help me spread my ideas:*

* *I use my network on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robinkwong), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/robin.kwong.12) and [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/robinkwong) to promote my posts*
* *I [speak publicly](http://srccon.org/sessions/#proposal-317223) and am trying to do more of it*
* *[I](http://www.poynter.org/2016/how-the-financial-times-is-getting-more-out-of-its-newsroom-experiments/410066/) [write](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/inside-the-financial-times-special-projects-strategy-six-months-on/s2/a663344/) [for](http://) or [syndicate](http://www.storybench.org/history-can-tell-us-future-interactive-journalism/) [my writing](http://www.storybench.org/newsrooms-need-project-managers/) to sites that cater to the audience I'm trying to reach, and let them help me with reach and distribution*


### Is there *any* reason why my writing should be bigger than major works of Russian literature in terms of file size?

No.

*I do not wish to contribute to the [website obesity crisis](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm). I also value your limited mobile data plan.*

## Being conscious of your default choices

I found it really useful to ask myself these questions from the outset for several reasons. They clarified my thinking and forced me to be very specific about what I was making this site for. This, in turn, made it easy to prioritise and set boundaries on what I would and would not do.

Above all, it helped me become conscious of what my default choices would be. It's not about being dogmatic with them, but default choices and settings are powerful: I want to make writing on here a habit and part of what means is that I can just do it without having to think through everything from first prinicples every time.

What are your default choices?
