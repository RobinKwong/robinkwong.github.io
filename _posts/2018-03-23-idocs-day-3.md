## Immersive Audioscapes

_Julian Konczak – Tracing Transcendental Tone: work in progress_

_Andrea Diaz – How to create a story-world about Carlos & Alvin?_

_Duncan Speakman – It Must Have Been Dark by Then_

### Julian Konczak

Work centers around the hidden and powerful effects of sacred sound. (i.e. how do you create intended transcendental experiences with digital)

![](/images/i-docs/sacred.JPG)

Pythagoras was interested in the ability to sound to push people into a more sacred space

This psycho-acoustic element has been revisited more recently: La Mont Young and drone choreography

Haunted Media: Media Archaeology and the idea that there is something going on (more esotheric and more etheric than what appears on the surface)

How to deal with multiplicity of platforms and atomisation of audience experinece?

### Andrea Diaz

How to create a story-world about Carlos & Alvin?

![](/images/i-docs/carlosalvin.JPG)

Carlos and Alvin are both blind.
Carlos: from Colombia, 34 years old, lives in Montreal. Works as a translator. grew up in an environment where he was given a lot of freedom and independence to explore as a child

Alvin: from the Bahamas, 32 years old. Also in Montreal. Grew up in an orphanage so was not allowed to be free and independent as a child - was given a cane very early on.

Carlos and Alvin met up. they're both immigrants in their 30s in Montreal; they're both premature babies and became blind because of the same medical error. They use the practice of echolocation to navigate

Could someone who is not blind learn the 'space as a sound language' (echolocation)

Was really hard - even if understood the theory, could not do it in practice.

So started by putting a 360 camera on a helmet for them to wear, and asked them to describe their process as they walked around the city.

It was interesting, but the video was basically awful. So decided to try again in a controlled environment. Chose Alvin's apartment to try this.

Put the film into an HTC Vive

Very excited to to make it, but when people tried it... they felt dizziness and couldn't continue

Decided to solve this by giving two versions of the same video - a stabilised version and Alvin's original version.

Sound:
Originally, had different layers - Voice narration, sound effects, ambient sound etc

Invited Carlos to come - ironic because we had to put the headset on him in order to help him understand VR and 3d digital images and all that.

Validated the audioscape with him. Carlos's reactionw as: Oh that's nice, but when are you going to have the whole sound of the room?' - he means reverb, and ambisonics (full, uninterrupted sphere of sound recorded with a 360 mic)

What's next:
Really want ot have a visualisation of the sound wave in the VR experience - because, otherwise it's so easy to disassociate. 

How do we archive our soundscapes?

### Duncan Speakman - It Must Have Been Dark by Then

![](/images/i-docs/dark.JPG)

[More info about It Must Have Been Dark By Then](https://ambientlit.com/index.php/it-must-have-been-dark-by-then/)

Don't like the term 'immersion' because when working about sound it's always immersive. Instead prefers 'presence'

Implication and Imbrication - overlapping of edges

Anthropocene, Locative Media, Geospatial

What's interesting and somewhat problematic is this relation between text and sound. when you are reading there's no temporality to it - you read 

You have this situation where your reading pace is framed by the audio - sometimes people get frustrated by it because they think they are ahead or behind

Really interested by this idea of giving time frames to printed objects

The reflections acts as a silencing of the world. It almost removes you from the space. It leaves you that time to contemplate the world around you.

Attempts to connect the 'gameplay' (of walking around) with the original text. In Douz, for example, people were not given a choice and


Things the work addresses:

The idea of layered experieneces. On journey out you are choosing places with your head down in the book. On way back, those things become layered. You remember being there half hour ago, but also you remember the story you have read.

Anthroprocene: Problem is that we understand it (and it has been framed)through modes of the visual.

Kanngeiser, 2015

Davis H & Turpin E: Art in the Antrhopocene

The layering of time - Shadowtime. A parallel 

This is augmented reality. This is not trying to create a fiction. (wanted to emphasise that the recording shows things actually happening and how it connects of where you are and what you are doing)

Next stage is to use microphones on the headphones. This allows blending in on live, real-time audio with pre-recorded. So, sound of wind in Bristol could blend into sound of wind in Tunisia. 

Starting from here and starting from where you are right now, and to work outward to other places.

Challenge with interactive work: If you have something to say, why let (make?) the player say it for you?

## The 'What If It' project

[The iFLab](http://www.iflab.net/)

Should we follow a specific methodology when producing an i-doc? What does that look like?

Work of the IF lab is to mix methodologies from multiple disciplines: storytelling, design, programming, etc

The process:

![](/images/i-docs/process.JPG)

Makers are guided through this by cards:

![](/images/i-docs/card.JPG)

And canvases:

![](/images/i-docs/canvas.JPG)

However, more interested in exploring these questions: Is this empowering or limiting? Is this the right mix of methodologies? How do we improve on this?

### The Forgotten War

Originally: knew that we wanted to do a documentary on the war in Eastern Ukraine from the locals' perspecive, and to do it in a non-linear way.  

When we started at iFLab, the first question was 'why'. This was surprising to us because we cared so much about the issue. 

This is how we reacted:

![](/images/i-docs/why.JPG)

But this pushed us to ask 'how do we engage with the audience?' Led to adding a main character and who the audience is in the story.

After raised funds and scouted in Ukraine, the 'Why' questions came up again. This time they were more radical: Why not VR, why not Instagram? Led us to a very paranoid and schizophrenic state of mind because they could be right but so could we.

Went back to original core of the project and our motivations for doing it.

### Reading diaries

What is the experience and process of reading diaries? It's not a book and it doesn't necessarily happen linearly. There's also the tactile and place etc (imbrication?)

Project centers around this guy and his diaries:
![](/images/i-docs/diaries.JPG)

What I'm doing is effectively looking at these diaries as a basis for my storytelling. 

There is a story that's almost pre-packed there and all it takes is a bit of organising. 

### Joanna Wright - Atomfa

Atomfa: Welsh colloquial word for nuclear power station.

documents the decomissioning of the power station in Snowdonia national park

![](/images/i-docs/nuclear.JPG)

Given pretty unfettered access to documents:

![](/images/i-docs/docs.JPG)

The plan was to decommission, destroy the documents lock the nuclear power plant, and leave it for a hundred years or so for people in the future to deal with.  "It's a bit of an 'Austin Powers'-type plan"

When came to iFLab, didn't have a structure. 

Tackled this with paper prototyping:

![](/images/i-docs/prototype1.JPG)

![](/images/i-docs/prototype2.JPG)

Also through interviewing people about their understanding of my project, which revealed the challenges that had to be overcome.

### Aashish Kumar

Body | Home | World
Queer Desi Journeys

Why interactive? wanted to bring together three diffrent sets of audiences: 

- Families

- Queer identifying individuals

- Activist or support orgs for queer identifying or their families

So, interactivity would allow an opportunity to create an environment similar to a 'meeting square' where the user could take multiple pathways to arrie at the same place

But lots of challenges and things to learn:

Need to have someone who has a design aesthetic that would be familiar both to someone in South Asia and someone in diaspora

Figure out what the navigation design would be.

Ambiguity about 'interactivity' and what's it for.

Thinking through and addressing fluid funding priorities, which is shifting from interactivity to VR/AR

When you're on the internet, the idea that you're reflecting back where the user is in the journey and feeding that back to them is crucial.

### Mike Robbins

People come with to !fLab with ideas but in between that and execution there is a big, wooly gap.

Design thinking is pretty new to the documentary field.

Who mentors the mentors? How do we learn and how do we learn? 

## Mixed Realities

*Mike Robbins and Harmke Heezen – Rematerialism: About the importance of being there – an exploration of digital installations in physical surroundings*

*Sophie Dixon – Giving Presence to the Past*

[Sorry - I missed the beginning of this session]

### Rematerialism

Explores question of how immersive digital stories can fit into a real world setting

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A model of the Great Synagogue in Aleppo, damaged in 1947, completely destroyed in 2016, in the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. The idea is to put people inside the model, giving the sense of tangibility <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/idocs2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#idocs2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/QDUkEIs4AC">pic.twitter.com/QDUkEIs4AC</a></p>&mdash; Lisa Gee (@LIS4G33) <a href="https://twitter.com/LIS4G33/status/977185753934585856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

Wnat to encourage people to actually be there. Digitising shouldn't be about "We've been to Machu Pichu and have scanned it and brought it to you in VR so you don't have to go there"

### Sophie Dixon (@sophiedixon1) - Giving Presence to the Past

[More on her projects](http://sophie-dixon.com/srbska/)

Wunschendorf: it's a place that is created through layers of stories, and changes with each visit, and wanted to recreate this for the viewer

How to do this? dual-screen installation

![](/images/i-docs/dual.JPG)

Using space as a means to expand fragments of narrative

Amassed archive of material - digital technology allowed people to encounter it in different ways.

Memory of Loci - HTC Vive experiment. Reconstructed fragment of house - only the parts that the interviewee remembers. The dark spaces and the empty spaces become just as important 

The Chorus - wanted to address one missing aspect of Memory of Loci - polyphony

In The Chorus, viewer is on Hololens mixed reality; and surrounded by 4 plinths which represent different voices. There's archival content (in hologram form) placed on the plinth.

Next experiment: How can you use mixed reality to bring to live heritage objects placed in a museum, which is often inanimate. i.e. a music box that could actually play music (in mixed reality)

Next experiment - Nomad: tackles issue of how when museum display objects, they do so within _the museum_ context (i.e. object is taken out of and disassociated from its original use context). Could we use archival footage and material to recreate the scene of the object's original use and 'recontextualise' it.
