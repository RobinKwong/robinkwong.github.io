## Immersive Audioscapes

_Julian Konczak – Tracing Transcendental Tone: work in progress_

_Andrea Diaz – How to create a story-world about Carlos & Alvin?_

### Julian Konczak

Work centers around the hidden and powerful effects of sacred sound. (i.e. how do you create intended transcendental experiences with digital)

Pythagoras was interested in the ability to sound to push people into a more sacred space

This psycho-acoustic element has been revisited more recently: La Mont Young and drone choreography

Haunted Media: Media Archaeology and the idea that there is something going on (more esotheric and more etheric than what appears on the surface)

How to deal with multiplicity of platforms and atomisation of audience experinece?
