I'll try to take live notes as I have in previous years. Here are my notes from EPIC [2022](https://robinkwong.com/epic2022-day-one/) [2021](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/), [2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018-summary/) and [2017](https://robinkwong.com/epic-day-four/). 

## Keynote: Folded Map: Disrupting Chicago's Friction through Art

_Tonika is a photographer, artist and life-long resident of Chicagoâ€™s Englewood neighborhood. Her work reveals injustices in real estate and land use practices and encourages us to create positive change. Her Folded Map project visually investigates disparities among segregated Chicagoans while bringing them together for conversation. She's been named a Chicagoan of the Year by Chicago Magazine, with previous exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Chicago Cultural Center, and more._
