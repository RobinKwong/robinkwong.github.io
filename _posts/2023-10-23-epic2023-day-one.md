I'm back at [EPIC](https://2022.epicpeople.org/)! This is one of my favourite conferences and it's happening in Chicago this year.

I'll try to take live notes as I have in previous years. Here are my notes from EPIC [2022](https://robinkwong.com/epic2022-day-one/) [2021](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/), [2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018-summary/) and [2017](https://robinkwong.com/epic-day-four/). 

## Keynote: Folded Map: Disrupting Chicago's Friction through Art

_Tonika is a photographer, artist and life-long resident of Chicagoâ€™s Englewood neighborhood. Her work reveals injustices in real estate and land use practices and encourages us to create positive change. Her Folded Map project visually investigates disparities among segregated Chicagoans while bringing them together for conversation. She's been named a Chicagoan of the Year by Chicago Magazine, with previous exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Chicago Cultural Center, and more._

Folded map - matches up residents on north and sotuh side of the city that are equidistant from the city centre, ie 6720 N Ashland and 6720 S Ashland. "Map Twins"

The legacy of racism is with us today in the current value of homes in Black neighborhoods

Greater Englewood home ownership rate is 30% becuase of land sale contracts - 596 greater englewood homes sold on land sale contracts

Imagine what greatere englewood could be today if people owned thier homes.

Inequity for sale project - installed 13 300lb concrete-based land markers at the addresses where houses were stolen. two of those were damaged/stolen. 

unBlocked Englewood project - What does public art actually look like? how can you transform and beautify a disadvantaged neighborhood when the people living there are struggling with basic living needs? Applied for a 500k grant (got 250k) to give to home owners for home repairs. Repairs to roof and structural damage enabled homewoners for federal free weatherization programmes.

"You can't do any of these creative placemaking projects in these places when people's homes are disinvested."

## Constituting Community

### The Transformative Power of Friction: Inclusive Community Center-ed Visioning in Manhattan's Chinatown
Paper by _Megan Marini, 3x3_

how to shift and disrupt power structures in participatory design

going to talk specifically about building at 70 Mulberry in Manhattan's Chinatown

![](/images/epic2023/mulberry.jpeg)

"how we can move towards autonomous communities"

70 Mulberry - orginally built as elementary school. many came to see their school as sanctuary. in 70s, became a community center and home to community-based organizations.

as of 2020, owned by NYC. big fire broke out. NYC committed $80m in funding to redevelop 70 Mulberry St.

"Root shock" - term coined in urban renewal re: upheaval of communities through urban renewal

started to see power hegemonies - friction between experts/bureaucracies and lived experiences; friction between different groups of communities. 

drew from "tools for conviviality" Ivan Illich - created an ontological and community-centered design approach

Dangers of partcicpatory design: 
Illusion of inclusion - glossing over voices who have not dominated our understanding of truth
Ladder of participation - Sherry Arnstein - participation without redistribution of power is empty and frustrating porcess for the powerless. i.e. participatory processes used to manipulated gruops

### In Search of Cultural Entropy: A Call for New Frameworks of Analysis (PechaKucha)
_Gunes Kocabag, Margin Innovation, Outsight International (Presenter)_

What does local even mean in our contemporary world?
New tech increasingly closed distance between different places and people
MTV generation-->global village culture around topics i.e. kpop, anime, etc

But while we see increasing homogenization of culture across geographic boundaires, we also see fragmentation into sub-groups

entropy: the measure of disorder

![](/images/epic2023/entropy.jpeg)

The order of time - carlo rovelli: the reason we perceive increasing entropy is because we have preconcieved ideas of order and disorder. 

There is order in all disorder, just depends on what lens we use to look at it

Cultures are as locla and as unique as they've always been. we need a new framework for thinking about it.

### Navigating Adoption by Global South Users: The Case of Wikimedia Volunteers (Case Study)
_Camille Kramer Courbariaux, YUX (Presenter)

Wikipedia community - not just people editing entries, but also hosting edit-a-thons. noticed that these editathons weren't being organized as much in global south. wanted to explore not just what their community is doing but also what other communities are doing that's successful in Africa

Identified 4 communities 4 counties.

research revealed friction between western assumptions and reality. The biggest one is that motiviation for volunteering is two-fold, instead of purely altruistic (true for wikipedians in global north who are mostly retirees).

Second friction was around assumption that tools and tech were the challenge. instead, organizing is peopel-first activity and steps taking to improve tech were not the ones needed, or helping solve the right problems. 

The assumption that wikipedia is a fair and objective source of information is also not the case - existing rules and structures for vetting wikipedia info disadvantages global south.
