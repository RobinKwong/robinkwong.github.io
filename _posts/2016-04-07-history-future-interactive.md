I’ve been thinking a lot recently about historical progress, cycles and how it relates to what we are trying to do with visual and digital storytelling today.

It all started with annotations. Specifically, the 300-odd words of text beneath this line chart from 1849 that was [unearthed by Scott Klein](https://www.guernicamag.com/daily/scott-klein-infographics-in-the-time-of-cholera/). In this text, the New York Tribune writer describes in detail not just the information the chart was meant to convey, but also how to read the chart and what conclusions to draw from it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1850&#39;s newspapers didn&#39;t really publish charts. <a href="https://twitter.com/kleinmatic">@kleinmatic</a> explains why. <a href="https://t.co/RSGxk8UN4a">https://t.co/RSGxk8UN4a</a> <a href="https://t.co/sUlxYis3vu">pic.twitter.com/sUlxYis3vu</a></p>&mdash; Aleszu Bajak (@aleszubajak) <a href="https://twitter.com/aleszubajak/status/714073496842801152">27 March 2016</a></blockquote>

It is clumsy and heavy-handed. The writer was trying to introduce a new form of storytelling enabled by technological changes and there is a tension between the vision of this new, more efficient form of storytelling versus the practical need to explain (perhaps even over-explain) it for readers in terms of the old, familiar format.  The end result was less efficient than both what came before it and what would come afterwards. But it was a necessary step in establishing the aesthetics of data visualisation.

The parallels with what we are now trying to do with the digital presentation of journalism are clear. We, too, are groping our way towards a new aesthetic. But instead of printed graphics, our new form uses a combination of text, code, graphics, audio, photos, videos or animation to create something akin to what Frank Chimero described as ‘flux’ in [*What screens want*](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/). 

For ease of reference, I’m going to use ‘interactive news’ as a shorthand to describe this as yet ill-defined new form through the rest of this piece, even though it is by no means a perfectly apt term.

Like the writer in Scott’s example, we are trying to contextualise and explain interactive news using familiar terms and metaphors. Often in equally clumsy ways. (Granted, some of us do so with greater elegance: See Gregor Aisch’s [NICAR16 lighting talk](http://slides.com/drivenbydata/nicar16#/), and [this example](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/01/us/police-bodycam-video.html?_r=0) of exactly the sort of thing he was extolling)

More than 166 years after the New York Tribune chart, line and bar charts are now more likely to be seen as tyrannical standards rather than a novelty.

It has also birthed related new forms. Note the heavy use of annotations here.

It is tempting to see all this a march of progress that leads to ever-greater literacy and sophistication in visual journalism. Instead, I am haunted by the prospect that we might simply be repeating past historical cycles. 

At this year’s [NICAR and Malofiej conferences](../03/tapestry-nicar-notes), two different strands of thought emerged about the future direction of interactive news. One was Gregor’s call to arms to produce works that derives their value uniquely from their interactivity.

The second came broadly from [Archie Tse](https://github.com/archietse/malofiej-2016/blob/master/tse-malofiej-2016-slides.pdf) and [Lena Groeger’s](http://bit.ly/malofiej24) talks at Malofiej.  Archie’s rules for visual storytelling and Lena’s coining of the ‘rhetorical scroll’ both emphasised how and when interactivity (in its broadest sense) should be used in the service of storytelling.

In listing them out, I do not wish to set these two stances against each other as mutually exclusive or in opposition. Instead, I think they represent two different approaches to interactive news.

But we have been here before. In the late 1990s and through much of the 2000s, the academic study of games broadly followed the same contours: one approach, called narratology, considered games as primarily storytelling devices and sought to place it among other narrative media like movies and novels. The other, broadly termed ludology, thought that narrative theories were the wrong lens to view games, which are instead primarily about the design of rules. Ludologists like Jasper Juul argued for a separate theory of games in [*What computer games can and can’t do*](http://www.jesperjuul.net/text/wcgcacd.html):

> We need a theory that isn’t just interactive bits and pieces tacked on to narratology or dramaturgy. We lack a theoretical understanding of what games are and can, and how they relate to the narrative media such as the novel or the movie. We lack the tools to evaluate and place a computer game both historically and in relation to other games.

In 1936, the growing popularity of film prompted Walter Benjamin to consider [*The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*](http://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content2/uploads/Benjamin-art.pdf). In particular, the socio-political implications of how reproducing works of art destroys the ‘aura’ attached to the original. 

In 1972, the growing popularity of the camera prompted John Berger to revisit and update Walter Benjamin’s theories, in [*Ways of Seeing*]( http://waysofseeingwaysofseeing.com/ways-of-seeing-john-berger-5.7.pdf). Reproduction destroys the authority of art, Berger argues, but it also creates a new language of images that could define our experiences and confer a new kind of power.

What, then, does our age of digital and socially-driven reproduction imply for the pieces of journalism we produce, and more broadly, for our ability to establish interactive news as a new aesthetic?

(Is it even useful to think of news as art? I think yes, to the extent that we are not merely providing information but are creating pieces that interpret the world and provide a directed experience for our audience)

In the pre-digital age, there was an aura attached to ambitious, original pieces of journalism. The scoop was fetishised; its power derived from its originality and limited availability (and, of course, its quality). But unlike the advent of films or cameras, digital reproduction and social media do not just destroy that aura. It subverts it. A work’s authority now derives precisely from its reproduction and being shared.  A tree falling in the woods with no one around to Facebook Live video it no longer makes a sound.

So if interactive news is to become a new aesthetic, it cannot be ignorant of, or stand apart from, this new language. But as Berger noted, there is more to a work than just its aura. Even more so than works of art, original pieces of journalism are testimonies to historical moments. Sometimes, they require contemplation; they cannot be ‘fully understood spontaneously’.

There is much more to explore in applying Walter Benjamin and John Berger’s thoughts to our present day situation. What does it mean, anyways, to take “a total approach to art which attempts to relate it to every aspect of experience”? ¯ \ _ (ツ) _/¯

I agree with John Berger’s conclusion that these are not narrow professional matters but a much larger issue that deserves more thought.  But in terms of establishing ‘interactive news’ as a new aesthetic, the approach needed is perhaps simpler: it will happen via the doing, rather than the theorising.

The question then becomes whether we are living in an era that facilitates the creation of interactive news that is ambitious in both style and content. The answer is surely yes. The same technological forces that are upending traditional publishing business models and destroying the mystical aura of the scoop are also giving us tools and skills that facilitate the creation of ambitious and experimental pieces of interactive news.  

It is in this, rather than a belief in the linear march of progress towards greater literacy and sophistication, that I find my optimism. The trend is, as Evan Ratliff argued in [*The Life and Death and Life of Magazines*](https://evan.atavist.com/the-life-and-death-and-life-of-magazines), not linear but cyclical. Yet we are in the ascendant part of the cycle, where the world is becoming unglued, and the human conditions necessary for the creation of great works are falling into place.

> Great magazine pieces, after all, grow out of a simple transaction: an editor saying yes to an idea and, in turn, to a writer. Yes to investing in a writer who will risk her time and even safety to venture into the world and return with a story that makes sense of it. Yes to a writer brave enough to lay bare her own personal past as a window into an important issue. Yes to a writer who imparts her intellect and humor in a fresh perspective on art or culture. (Of course, great magazine writing involves more than just saying yes. It involves the editor eventually saying no: no to lazy phrasing, no to shaky facts, no to reporting shortcuts. When longform writing fails—as it did dangerously in widely-discussed incidents in Grantland and Rolling Stone not long ago, it is not because of the names we give it, the hashtags we apply to it, or its word-count ambitions. It fails because an editor declined to say no to facts that weren’t checked, or to a piece whose ambition had overstepped its humanity.)

Here’s to an era of saying yes.
