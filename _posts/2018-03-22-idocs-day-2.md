These are my day 2 (Thursday 22 March) notes for [iDocs 2018](https://idocs2018.dcrc.org.uk/), a three day event dedicated to the expanding & evolving field of interactive documentary, in Bristol.

[Day 1 notes](/idocs-day-1/)

## Telling Stories with Data

*Roberto Malfagia – Data driven stories*

*Bronwin Patrickson – Mobilising the record: The Documentary Functions of Mobile Tracking Applications*

*Julia Scott-Stevenson – Ethics and mess in data storytelling*

### Roberto Malfagia

When 14, went on trip with parents to Ravenna. Saw mosaic in church.

Churches in Italy = Multimedia buildings of the past

Mosaic of Christ was cinematic. It seemed to move.

Confabulations by John Berger: Character goes to see that same mosaic in the Ravenna church. The tiles "have different colours. but not only. The same colours have different shape." - also different angles of insertion into the mortar

This arrangement creates a certain visual effect. the still image moves because the light reflected in the fragments move. it transfigures: it reveals itself.

What are the basic elements - the tiles - of which a story is made up?

Robert McKee: Story is constructed of a series of events, which means change. This creates a significant change in the character. specifically, in the character's value. Each change is 'beat'. Each action pushes the story

What about data? Data expresses a value. Frames a phenomenon. Like Mosaic tile, data can express a certain shape

Example: Michael Najjar - High Altitude. Modified a mountain landscape photo to fit the shape of the a line chart of the Dax stock price. Suggests data (and perhaps finance) is shaping the world around us.

Next project: Private astronomy. on hold because uses the same type of research agreement to access Facebook data as Cambridge Analytica did.

### Bronwin Patrickson - Mobilising the Record

What constitutes a documentary? 

Two projects around mobile phone as a recording device:
1. Student who installed spyware on his own phone so that he could see the person who stole his phone and what they did
2. ABC journalist in Australia who posted online the mobile data collected by his phone (location, etc)

Which of these are documentary? both?

Algorithmic editing and the possibilities that it opens up for new ways of looking at the world.

This includes things like Narrative Clip camera that takes photo every 30 seconds
but also things like Facebook's 'this is your FB birthday / This was your year' clips

Issues around ownership/consent/control of data. But also 

Data is created and shaped by what we choose to care about.


### Julia Scott-Stevenson: Ethics and mess in data storytelling

The complex messiness of what it means to be human in data stories

The tension between deindividualisation and personalisation: Seen through algorithms that sort us into groups.

Delour: we beome dividuals(?) (not individuals)

This is not new. There's long been concern about individuals 'disappearing into the numbers'.

But digital technology accelerates this. 

Finely targetted political advertising is worrying. 

But more worrying is targetting and explicitly amplifying vulnerable emotional states. 

[I love Alaska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-SOCGdPyNU) in 2006 AOL accidentally dumped user data online. producers took search terms from user 711391 and built a web series based on the search term. 

We're in a bind: Should we withdraw and insulate, or dive in and improve the algorithms


(one reason why we should dive in) There are creative possibilities in this data. Educational possibilities, cultural capital possibilities. 'I love Alaska' and [We feel fine](http://wefeelfine.org/)

Is it different when it's an artist doing this rather than an advertiser?

How do we keep these stories complex and retain the human?
Documentarians have dealt with these ethical questions for a long time (Nanook of the North, 1922)

Documentary: uses micro-stories to connect to macro-stories. It's about making a connection

One potential answer to how we keep the complex and human: We can make stories understand you (i.e. personalised stories)
['Do not track'](https://www.upian.com/en/project/donottrack) for example.

With personalised stories, key is to keep the connection to the broader story. How do we use this personalisation to draw connection to others? Personalised stories could just be a way to give us more of what we want. 

Rather than more theorising, we need more making. The brief:
