I returned to the OpenNews unconference on journalism and technology this year to facilitate a discussion on the topic of project initiation.

The workshop's idea is that the start of a project is important in determining its subsequent success, and can take many forms. Project initiation ranges from drafting formal pitches that are then scored according to structured categories, to casual conversations sparking an idea that gathers momentum and becomes a project without anyone consciously deciding to make it a project.

The workshop was intended to draw out people's experience and stories and provide a space to learn from each other about what challenges are particularly difficult at the start of a project as well as what tactics and techniques work in addressing those challenges.

Projects start in different ways, from a single visionary or founder coming up with an idea, to projects emerging from organisational priorities, to regularly-scheduled brainstorming sessions. It was particularly interesting to hear some participants say they are actively thinking about how to shape the start of a project (moving from single visionary with an idea, to a process of co-creation)

Likewise, participants named a wide range of reasons for why certain projects go ahead. There wasn't much discussion around whether a particular approval or selection mechanism is better (other than a near-universal scepticism about the effectiveness of formal scoring systems). Instead, these were mostly seen as 'just how things work' in a given organisation or industry, or as tactics to ensure your project would go ahead.

There was quite a bit of agreement about what are the important information to capture at the start of a project

We then brainstormed a list of challenges peculiar to the project initiation phase. This list served as the prompt for smaller group discussions about how to address these challenges. I found the tips about contingency planning and keeping a decision log particularly helpful:
