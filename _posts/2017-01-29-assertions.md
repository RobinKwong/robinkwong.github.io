Here are three beliefs I hold that underpin nearly everything I do in my work.

I might be wrong about them and I'm certain that there are plenty who would disagree with them. Nor do I have any [data that would prove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wK7wsSdhmo) that these assertions are true &hellip; yet.

But I'm committed to creating the change that will make these seem obvious &mdash; in hindsight.

- I believe that we are entering a [golden age for digital journalism](/history/)

- I believe news organisations have commercial, civic and artistic imperatives and it’s possible to for an organisation to fulfill all three

- I believe these are the ways in which newsrooms can thrive financially and do better journalism:
	- By conversing with our readers instead of broadcasting to them
	- By having [well-managed small teams](https://medium.com/swlh/what-are-things-like-around-here-fb11cc1f4e8d#.d0gdpc53d) doing projects alongside a ‘production line’ of news
	- By breaking down traditional silos of editorial, commercial and technology 

**What are your assertions?**
