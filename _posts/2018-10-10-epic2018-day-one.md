## Conference Chairs' Welcome

Theme of this conference: What counts as evidence?

[missed a chunk here, but basically - a large part of this conference is an experiment in bringing quant and qual together]

This is not just a response to some technical development (i.e. big data, AI etc)

But there are things happening in the world that make this particularly relevant: For example: 

- the post-fact, fake news world 

- Rise of Audit Cultures: Org's obsessions with metrics become self-fulfilling prophecies without regards to consequences. leads to bullshit jobs (Graeber)

"Ethnography doesn't give you a get-out-of-bullshit-free card", but gives us a chance to find some meaningfulness in a sea of bullshit

"Bullshit actually has a really specific definition in philosophy"

The problem of indifference has now taken on an entirely new salience.

The workers in this hotel are contemplating a strike. others have done so. in part this is about their evidence and their needs have not been heard. They're striking over the ability to meet basic needs, to be protected against sexual assault, and the ability ot be involved in decisions about automation that affect them.

The problem we have with evidence is not an audit culture problem but a Hannah Arendt problem. We can make better or worse choices about what we measure and how measure them, but we can also make decisions about how to keep measurement in its place. When power coheres with indifference, when evidence starts to not matter, then we should worry. Because no one escapes unscathed from that.

Arendt: Evil happens when people get exceedingly good at doing their job only within narrow confines, when people get really good at bullshit jobs. 

Re: hotel workers - the difference is not between truth and untruth, but truth and uncaringness.
