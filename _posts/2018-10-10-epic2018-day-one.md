## Conference Chairs' Welcome

Theme of this conference: What counts as evidence?

[missed a chunk here, but basically - a large part of this conference is an experiment in bringing quant and qual together]

This is not just a response to some technical development (i.e. big data, AI etc)

But there are things happening in the world that make this particularly relevant: For example: 

- the post-fact, fake news world 

- Rise of Audit Cultures: Org's obsessions with metrics become self-fulfilling prophecies without regards to consequences. leads to bullshit jobs (Graeber)

"Ethnography doesn't give you a get-out-of-bullshit-free card", but gives us a chance to find some meaningfulness in a sea of bullshit

"Bullshit actually has a really specific definition in philosophy"

The problem of indifference has now taken on an entirely new salience.

The workers in this hotel are contemplating a strike. others have done so. in part this is about their evidence and their needs have not been heard. They're striking over the ability to meet basic needs, to be protected against sexual assault, and the ability ot be involved in decisions about automation that affect them.

The problem we have with evidence is not an audit culture problem but a Hannah Arendt problem. We can make better or worse choices about what we measure and how measure them, but we can also make decisions about how to keep measurement in its place. When power coheres with indifference, when evidence starts to not matter, then we should worry. Because no one escapes unscathed from that.

Arendt: Evil happens when people get exceedingly good at doing their job only within narrow confines, when people get really good at bullshit jobs. 

Re: hotel workers - the difference is not between truth and untruth, but truth and uncaringness.

## Keynote: Cooperation without submission: Some insights from Hopi-US Engagements

_Justin B. Richland is Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago and Research Professor at the American Bar Foundation. His research explores the language, culture and politics of contemporary Native American jurisprudence._

Shows an illustration of Ethnologist Mathilda Coxe Stevenson trying to enter a hopi kiva.

At the time, this was a photo of intreprid researcher/ethnolographer. Nowadays its an image of Hopi refusal. 

This talk:

What do Hopi-Euro/American interactions tell us about how knowledge is produced and communicated between two groups that don't have much in common.

The limits that the Hopi present to Euro-American knowledge resonates with how they police knowledge within their culture as well

Their refusal to share knowledge doesn't shut down relations, they are invitations to participate on Hopi norms and values.

How all this study led to a scene of Hopi 'meaningful tribal consultation'

The way Hopi engages is more than just about conveying information, its enacts the relationships, values and norm that allow the transfer of knowledge at all.

### Knowing, norming and relating

Classic definition of knowledge: "justified true belief"

i.e. S _knows_ proposition P iff: P is true, S believes P is true, and S is justified in believing that P is true

Key bit he wants to focus on here is 'justified'. Why is this necessary?

Robert Brandom: coin-toss thought experiment. 

Say I tell you before I flip it that I believe it to be heads. aaaannnd...

(flips coin)

it turns out to be head.

So, was it a true belief? (yes)

But did he *know* it was going to be heads?

Probably no (because doesn't fit 'justified' criteria)

We'd want to know more behind the resoning. but what reasons would count? The bar for what counts as 'justified' is a shared norm.

This is the same as for the Hopi, when it comes to their secrets and knowledge, 

### Hopi knowledge & consultation with USFS

What Hopi are taught in their culture: cooperation without submission

Hopi reservation in Arizona - about 70k residents, 12 villages around 3 mesas. Before 1936 they (each village) were self-governing. In 1936 they were federated into a Hopi tribal nation.

Each clan contributes to the making and remaking of village community is by performing ceremonies.

Navoti: Secret ceremonial knowledge of each clan, a source of decentralised social power and authority.

This poses a problem for Anglophones who want to know everything For Hopi, the certainty associated with not-knowing is a form of cultural knowledge

The consultation: wanted to know about a piece of Tonto land and proposal for private sale. Turns out the land doesn't just contain sites of human habitation, but is bound with their obligations to care for the land. It's not just a space, it's a _place_

Hopi objected to the information that the USFS planned to sell the land, and that the forest archaeologist suggested excavating the sites (and wanted Hopi co-operation to justify that so that they could apply for federal funds to do so). But they agreed to continue the consultation.

The official criteria and rules for what counts as 'significance' underwrites a scientific understanding and ignores the Hopi way of life and their understanding of 'significance'

An intervention happens during the expedition: A grey hawk lands nearby. Hopi interpret it as the visitation of an ancestor.

![](images/epic2018/greyhawk.JPG) 

This obligates them to take offerings down to where the grey hawk landed and leave it there.

## Conclusion

The Forest Service didn't end up listening to the Hopi, and sale of the land was completed by the end of Summer. Some of the 
Hopi Cultural Preservation Office expressed doubt as to what the point of the consultation was at all. But:  

"Heck, if Cortez came to consult, would the Hopi do it?"

"Yes: I guess even the ignorant have to be treated with respect"

We have to agree on the norms and values of what is and isn't evidence that will justify our true beliefs.

Even in this time of alternative facts and fake news, these question seems more pressing than ever. They beg more questions - around epistemology and whether its wide enough.

Maybe what we can all do for each other right now is to engage in a bit of cooperation without submission

Q: Is the evidence of embodied stories of ancestors or other similar kinds of evidence ever as convincing for action as "science" (forest service in this case)?

A: depends on what you mean by action, and what science produces. The question of what is true echoes what we care about. This echoes Bruno Latour and climate change sceptics and how they take up social embodiment of knowledge. We should not be talking about matters of fact at all but matters of concern. What are the ends to which the facts and knowledge are being used?

Q: Can you talk about your selection of quotes from Hopi team members—and transcription conventions on your slides—as practices of evidence making?

A: I'm very much a part of the knowledge production around Hopi and held at arms length by them (despite working with them for 25 years and an appellate judge on their court). they vet the transcriptions. You are constantly making choices about what to include and wht not. every transcript is a theory of what counts. have different sets of this transcript - some that shows syllabic breakdown, some that shows inbreath and outbreath, etc. each of those is to make a case. These were chosen to show where assertions about traditional knowledge were being made. Again, it depends on what your concern is.

Our profession needs to do a better job at translating the labour intensivity of our work.


My key takewayss:
- We should speak about matters of concern, rather than matters of fact
- Knowledge cannot be separated from the shared norm and values that separate what is justified and unjustified belief
- Maybe what we can all do for each other right now is to engage in a bit of cooperation without submission
- Every transcript/artefact of knowledge production is a theory of what counts
