## Conference Chairs' Welcome

Theme of this conference: What counts as evidence?

[missed a chunk here, but basically - a large part of this conference is an experiment in bringing quant and qual together]

This is not just a response to some technical development (i.e. big data, AI etc)

But there are things happening in the world that make this particularly relevant: For example: 

- the post-fact, fake news world 

- Rise of Audit Cultures: Org's obsessions with metrics become self-fulfilling prophecies without regards to consequences. leads to bullshit jobs (Graeber)

"Ethnography doesn't give you a get-out-of-bullshit-free card", but gives us a chance to find some meaningfulness in a sea of bullshit

"Bullshit actually has a really specific definition in philosophy"

The problem of indifference has now taken on an entirely new salience.

The workers in this hotel are contemplating a strike. others have done so. in part this is about their evidence and their needs have not been heard. They're striking over the ability to meet basic needs, to be protected against sexual assault, and the ability ot be involved in decisions about automation that affect them.

The problem we have with evidence is not an audit culture problem but a Hannah Arendt problem. We can make better or worse choices about what we measure and how measure them, but we can also make decisions about how to keep measurement in its place. When power coheres with indifference, when evidence starts to not matter, then we should worry. Because no one escapes unscathed from that.

Arendt: Evil happens when people get exceedingly good at doing their job only within narrow confines, when people get really good at bullshit jobs. 

Re: hotel workers - the difference is not between truth and untruth, but truth and uncaringness.

## Keynote: Cooperation without submission: Some insights from Hopi-US Engagements

_Justin B. Richland is Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago and Research Professor at the American Bar Foundation. His research explores the language, culture and politics of contemporary Native American jurisprudence._

Shows an illustration of Ethnologist Mathilda Coxe Stevenson trying to enter a hopi kiva.

At the time, this was a photo of intreprid researcher/ethnolographer. Nowadays its an image of Hopi refusal. 

This talk:

What do Hopi-Euro/American interactions tell us about how knowledge is produced and communicated between two groups that don't have much in common.

The limits that the Hopi present to Euro-American knowledge resonates with how they police knowledge within their culture as well

Their refusal to share knowledge doesn't shut down relations, they are invitations to participate on Hopi norms and values.

How all this study led to a scene of Hopi 'meaningful tribal consultation'

The way Hopi engages is more than just about conveying information, its enacts the relationships, values and norm that allow the transfer of knowledge at all.

### Knowing, norming and relating

Classic definition of knowledge: "justified true belief"

i.e. S _knows_ proposition P iff: P is true, S believes P is true, and S is justified in believing that P is true

Key bit he wants to focus on here is 'justified'. Why is this necessary?

Robert Brandom: coin-toss thought experiment. 

Say I tell you before I flip it that I believe it to be heads. aaaannnd...

(flips coin)

it turns out to be head.

So, was it a true belief? (yes)

But did he *know* it was going to be heads?

Probably no (because doesn't fit 'justified' criteria)

We'd want to know more behind the resoning. but what reasons would count? The bar for what counts as 'justified' is a shared norm.

This is the same as for the Hopi, when it comes to their secrets and knowledge, 

### Hopi knowledge & consultation with USFS

What Hopi are taught in their culture: cooperation without submission

Hopi reservation in Arizona - about 70k residents, 12 villages around 3 mesas. Before 1936 they (each village) were self-governing. In 1936 they were federated into a Hopi tribal nation.

Each clan contributes to the making and remaking of village community is by performing ceremonies.

Navoti: Secret ceremonial knowledge of each clan, a source of decentralised social power and authority.

This poses a problem for Anglophones who want to know everything For Hopi, the certainty associated with not-knowing is a form of cultural knowledge

The consultation: wanted to know about a piece of Tonto land and proposal for private sale. Turns out the land doesn't just contain sites of human habitation, but is bound with their obligations to care for the land. It's not just a space, it's a _place_

Hopi objected to the information that the USFS planned to sell the land, and that the forest archaeologist suggested excavating the sites (and wanted Hopi co-operation to justify that so that they could apply for federal funds to do so). But they agreed to continue the consultation.

The official criteria and rules for what counts as 'significance' underwrites a scientific understanding and ignores the Hopi way of life and their understanding of 'significance'

An intervention happens during the expedition: A grey hawk lands nearby.
