## Opening address

Theme of this conference: What counts as evidence?

[missed a chunk here, but basically - a large part of this conference is an experiment in bringing quant and qual together]

This is not just a response to some technical development (i.e. big data, AI etc)

But there are things happening in the world that make this particularly relevant: For example: 

- the post-fact, fake news world 

- Rise of Audit Cultures: Org's obsessions with metrics become self-fulfilling prophecies without regards to consequences. leads to bullshit jobs

"Ethnography doesn't give you a get-out-of-bullshit-free card", but gives us a chance to find some meaningfulness in a sea of bullshit

"Bullshit actually has a really specific definition in philosophy"
