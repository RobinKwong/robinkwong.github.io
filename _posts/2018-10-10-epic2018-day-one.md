## Conference Chairs' Welcome

Theme of this conference: What counts as evidence?

[missed a chunk here, but basically - a large part of this conference is an experiment in bringing quant and qual together]

This is not just a response to some technical development (i.e. big data, AI etc)

But there are things happening in the world that make this particularly relevant: For example: 

- the post-fact, fake news world 

- Rise of Audit Cultures: Org's obsessions with metrics become self-fulfilling prophecies without regards to consequences. leads to bullshit jobs (Graeber)

"Ethnography doesn't give you a get-out-of-bullshit-free card", but gives us a chance to find some meaningfulness in a sea of bullshit

"Bullshit actually has a really specific definition in philosophy"

The problem of indifference has now taken on an entirely new salience.

The workers in this hotel are contemplating a strike. others have done so. in part this is about their evidence and their needs have not been heard. They're striking over the ability to meet basic needs, to be protected against sexual assault, and the ability ot be involved in decisions about automation that affect them.

The problem we have with evidence is not an audit culture problem but a Hannah Arendt problem. We can make better or worse choices about what we measure and how measure them, but we can also make decisions about how to keep measurement in its place. When power coheres with indifference, when evidence starts to not matter, then we should worry. Because no one escapes unscathed from that.

Arendt: Evil happens when people get exceedingly good at doing their job only within narrow confines, when people get really good at bullshit jobs. 

Re: hotel workers - the difference is not between truth and untruth, but truth and uncaringness.

## Keynote: Cooperation without submission: Some insights from Hopi-US Engagements

_Justin B. Richland is Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago and Research Professor at the American Bar Foundation. His research explores the language, culture and politics of contemporary Native American jurisprudence._

Shows an illustration of Ethnologist Mathilda Coxe Stevenson trying to enter a hopi kiva.

At the time, this was a photo of intreprid researcher/ethnolographer. Nowadays its an image of Hopi refusal. 

This talk:

What do Hopi-Euro/American interactions tell us about how knowledge is produced and communicated between two groups that don't have much in common.

The limits that the Hopi present to Euro-American knowledge resonates with how they police knowledge within their culture as well

Their refusal to share knowledge doesn't shut down relations, they are invitations to participate on Hopi norms and values.

How all this study led to a scene of Hopi 'meaningful tribal consultation'

The way Hopi engages is more than just about conveying information, its enacts the relationships, values and norm that allow the transfer of knowledge at all.

### Knowing, norming and relating

Classic definition of knowledge: "justified true belief"

i.e. S _knows_ proposition P iff: P is true, S believes P is true, and S is justified in believing that P is true

Key bit he wants to focus on here is 'justified'. Why is this necessary?

Robert Brandom: coin-toss thought experiment. 

Say I tell you before I flip it that I believe it to be heads. aaaannnd...

(flips coin)

it turns out to be head.

So, was it a true belief? (yes)

But did he *know* it was going to be heads?

Probably no (because doesn't fit 'justified' criteria)

We'd want to know more behind the resoning. but what reasons would count? The bar for what counts as 'justified' is a shared norm.

This is the same as for the Hopi, when it comes to their secrets and knowledge, 

### Hopi knowledge & consultation with USFS

What Hopi are taught in their culture: cooperation without submission

Hopi reservation in Arizona - about 70k residents, 12 villages around 3 mesas. Before 1936 they (each village) were self-governing. In 1936 they were federated into a Hopi tribal nation.

![](/images/epic2018/hopi.jpg)

Each clan contributes to the making and remaking of village community is by performing ceremonies.

Navoti: Secret ceremonial knowledge of each clan, a source of decentralised social power and authority.

This poses a problem for Anglophones who want to know everything For Hopi, the certainty associated with not-knowing is a form of cultural knowledge

The consultation: wanted to know about a piece of Tonto land and proposal for private sale. Turns out the land doesn't just contain sites of human habitation, but is bound with their obligations to care for the land. It's not just a space, it's a _place_

Hopi objected to the information that the USFS planned to sell the land, and that the forest archaeologist suggested excavating the sites (and wanted Hopi co-operation to justify that so that they could apply for federal funds to do so). But they agreed to continue the consultation.

The official criteria and rules for what counts as 'significance' underwrites a scientific understanding and ignores the Hopi way of life and their understanding of 'significance'

An intervention happens during the expedition: A grey hawk lands nearby. Hopi interpret it as the visitation of an ancestor.

![](/images/epic2018/grey_hawk.JPG)

This obligates them to take offerings down to where the grey hawk landed and leave it there.

### Conclusion

The Forest Service didn't end up listening to the Hopi, and sale of the land was completed by the end of Summer. Some of the 
Hopi Cultural Preservation Office expressed doubt as to what the point of the consultation was at all. But:  

"Heck, if Cortez came to consult, would the Hopi do it?"

"Yes: I guess even the ignorant have to be treated with respect"

We have to agree on the norms and values of what is and isn't evidence that will justify our true beliefs.

Even in this time of alternative facts and fake news, these question seems more pressing than ever. They beg more questions - around epistemology and whether its wide enough.

Maybe what we can all do for each other right now is to engage in a bit of cooperation without submission

Q: Is the evidence of embodied stories of ancestors or other similar kinds of evidence ever as convincing for action as "science" (forest service in this case)?

A: depends on what you mean by action, and what science produces. The question of what is true echoes what we care about. This echoes Bruno Latour and climate change sceptics and how they take up social embodiment of knowledge. We should not be talking about matters of fact at all but matters of concern. What are the ends to which the facts and knowledge are being used?

Q: Can you talk about your selection of quotes from Hopi team members—and transcription conventions on your slides—as practices of evidence making?

A: I'm very much a part of the knowledge production around Hopi and held at arms length by them (despite working with them for 25 years and an appellate judge on their court). they vet the transcriptions. You are constantly making choices about what to include and wht not. every transcript is a theory of what counts. have different sets of this transcript - some that shows syllabic breakdown, some that shows inbreath and outbreath, etc. each of those is to make a case. These were chosen to show where assertions about traditional knowledge were being made. Again, it depends on what your concern is.

Our profession needs to do a better job at translating the labour intensivity of our work.

My key takewayss:
- We should speak about matters of concern, rather than matters of fact
- Knowledge cannot be separated from the shared norm and values that separate what is justified and unjustified belief
- Maybe what we can all do for each other right now is to engage in a bit of cooperation without submission
- Every transcript/artefact of knowledge production is a theory of what counts

## Rehumanising Data

### Mattresses & Moneyboxes: Cultural Affordances for Microfinance in Jordan
Zach Hyman · Continuum (@sqInchAnthro)

![](/images/epic2018/mattresses.jpg)

The challenge: Design a service that allows clients to more easily receive and repay loans.

Set off across Jordan - 5 different cities and villages, using stimuli - illustrated cards - to talk about anything that we thought might affect their ability to repay microloans.

Very quickly in one of the conversation a woman came with a tray of teas - one for each person there, and they then sat down and participated in the conversation as a social event, even though she had no knowledge of microloans.

![](/images/epic2018/tea.JPG)

Why did she interpret it as a social event rather than a formal interview? Our local fixer advised providing in-kind incentives instead of money, so we brought boxes of stuff, and to make it less intimidating we put bows around it - it looks like a gift.

Some things they found:
Remoteness of villages from bank branches. The difficulties in saving that comes from unexpected happenigns, and objects such as hassalah - what westerners might call piggy banks.

We found that those who most often repaid microloans were people who used hassalah

![](/images/epic2018/hassalah.JPG)

Cultural affordance: a culturally specific, iconographic image. 
for example - the iOS notepad is yellow lined paper, but in Japanese culture, notepaper is white background, dotted grid.

We saw that people in Jordan used wallets to store money. But that they do NOT use their phones for storing money. 

So we tested something based off of the hassalah. Something that helps people save a bit of money regularly.
We made phone as an anciliary device and the centre of the product around in-person interactions with trusted local merchants. 

![](/images/epic2018/repayment.JPG)

Not all of our recommendations were immediately adopted, but it's clear that our ethnographic research created clear wins. 

They could make gradual repayments at local phone shops, could submit documents via taking a photo on their phone, give clearer receipts and loan tracking (addresses worries around losing paper receipts)

Q: What makes a reallly good fixer?
A: Someone who can roll with the punches. Try to find fixers who have worked with journalists before.

### When Customer Insights Meet Business Constraints: Building a Go-to-Market Strategy for a Smart Home Offering in a Regulated Space

Liz Kelley & Amanda Dwelley · ILLUME Advising

Every project operates under constraints - but this had some special constraints: State regulation needs them to prove that the product would result in energy saving for consumers. Also, when we were brought on, customer had already chosen a product and a vendor.

So, there were already assumptions and constraints in place. But, what if customer needs don't align with client assumptions or project constraints? 

With large-scale research projects, you only get the answers to the questions you ask, so it's important to put the ethnographic / qualitat

Client assumed that product would appeal to early adopters, like Rick. But when we went in and did research, found that they were actually already using other/rival services and are sceptical about using an offering from a utility. Instead, found people like Melissa.

![](/images/epic2018/personas.JPG)

This allowed them to surface the areas in which the product features don't match up with customer and utility preferences. 

Other things we learned: Security is often framed around being secure against an outsider or force, but actually customers saw it as security and safety of the family members within the home

This helped:

- refine concept

- more realistic estiamte of the size of the market and rate of adoption

- better propensity scores for individuals: 

The project wasn't really an open-ended question about 'what would work best?' But this doesn't mean that the ethnographic methods were not useful - it still helped in answering the question of 'would this work?' (and our answer was 'a qualified maybe') This shows that ethnography can be a part of a layered process.

Q: How, when doing this sort of work with stakeholders, do you stop people from jumping to conclusions?

A: Helps to frame it correctly from the start. Also, helps that we weren't making wholesale recommendations from the start. Means you can introduce bits of insights gradually.

### ReHumanizing Hospital Satisfaction Data: Text Analysis, the Lifeworld, and Contesting Stakeholders’ Beliefs in Evidence
Julia Wignall & Dwight Barry · Seattle Children’s Hospital

[Sorry - missesd the beginning of this]

Issues around staff communication around intensive care, long surgery procedures, etc - The capturing of the feedback of all this gets reduced into a single patient satisfaction score.

Wrinkle is that Medicaid and funding will soon be tied to this one patient satisfaction score.

The challenge:

![](/images/epic2018/humanise.JPG)  

Techniques to tackle this:

- End user reading: getting stakeholders and stakeholders to actually read the verbatim feedback from. Most leaders can readily identify the problem areas, but when we spoke to them they mostly felt they cannot do anything about it. THey mainly wanted us to thelp them bring evidence to light so they can obtain the high level support they need.

We did further content analysis but really struggled to get from their to concrete recommendations. Most feedback mainly just said they felt wait times were too long. Content analysis alone was not enough

We tried different types and methods of text mining. But..

We expected this. Most of these things cannot provide meaning.
