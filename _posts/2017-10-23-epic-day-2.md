## Dana Sherwood: Culinary Habitats and Feral Cakes

![](/images/feral-cake.jpg)

When you invite the chaos of nature as a collaborator there's no telling what's going to happen

Although we live in the anthropocene era when everything has been manipulated by mankind, there's something hopeful in animals just being animals

Work has always been culinary and very experimental

[The Ladies Society of Alchemical Agriculture, 2009](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-ladies-society-of-alchemical-agriculture-2009) - combined terrarrium with a culinary delicacy that represents that particular area of the US (i.e. Maine lobster, NY hot dog, etc) that over the three months of the exhibition, will decay and become it's own ecosystem.

[The Confectionary Wonders of Buffalo](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-confectionery-wonders-of-buffalo-2010) - cakes made in shape of Buffalo's iconic buildings and left to survive the buffalo winter. decay of cake mirrors decay of the city.

Then, became very interested in what would happen if live animals were part of the destruction.

So, next project was [Bacchanal](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/bacchanal-2010-12)

~An amazingly funny story about the opening of that exhibition that's too long to relate here~

Learnt an important lesson: Animals almost never behave the way you expect them to, and usually they do the exact opposite

After Bacchanal, learnt better  than to rely solely on nature guides to what animals will eat: For next project, did as much research on youtube watching vids of baboons eating pizza etc as reading nature papers on fruits, nuts etc are their natural diet

### [Picnic at Cape Point](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/picnic-at-cape-point-2012/1)

Went to set up picnic really early, but no baboons came. so packed up and drove around and found baboons - but along with a lot of tourists. so, dropped cakes on side of road and circled back to observe.

One tourist: "Oh My God that babooon just stole someone's birthday cake!"

I had managed to salvage something from this project but it wasn't the theatrical comedy I had imagine.

Because there are no longer divisions in our territories, we all share the same crippled space. We become companion species with animals. Food fuctions in her work as a metaphor for the ways in which the nature states are turned into culture

She tries to do justice with her animal collaborators in creating meaning together. Became a mediator in nature and culture, along with all the pitfalls and lessons learnt along the way.

Work now has two parts: field work, and in studio, where she edits video, creates sculptures and makes drawings.

Reflections on nature have affected the way she does her drawings. 

Previously, was very contorlled. didn't want any mistakes. Wanted it very tight.

But in watching animals, found so much beauty in vulnerability and unpredicatiblity in them. Projects that go wrong are the ones that have most feeling and are most memorable.

Now, she doesn't allow herself to spend so much energy making a perfect drawing. Just paper, paint and the most meaningful one minute sketches as possible. Even though they are full of chance marks, they didn't look like mistakes. They look free. She no longer had a headache after spending hours painting.

You have these preconceptions, and you *always* fall trap to anthrpomorphic thinking. It's so ingrained about how we think about nature that it's really hard to get past.

Denmark proejct: [The wild and the tamed](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-wild-and-the-tame-2015/1)

Even though this project was a failure, it highlights something aboout wildness. there's something hopeful about animals just being animals. Converted field work into a sculpture+video installation

The consistent theme is control. Animals have their own subjectivity. We love nature, but the moment they come into our territory or encroach, we try to dominate and anthropomorphasise and control it.
