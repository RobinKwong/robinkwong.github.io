## Dana Sherwood: Culinary Habitats and Feral Cakes

![](/images/feral-cake.JPG)

When you invite the chaos of nature as a collaborator there's no telling what's going to happen

Although we live in the anthropocene era when everything has been manipulated by mankind, there's something hopeful in animals just being animals

Work has always been culinary and very experimental

[The Ladies Society of Alchemical Agriculture, 2009](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-ladies-society-of-alchemical-agriculture-2009) - combined terrarrium with a culinary delicacy that represents that particular area of the US (i.e. Maine lobster, NY hot dog, etc) that over the three months of the exhibition, will decay and become it's own ecosystem.

[The Confectionary Wonders of Buffalo](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-confectionery-wonders-of-buffalo-2010) - cakes made in shape of Buffalo's iconic buildings and left to survive the buffalo winter. decay of cake mirrors decay of the city.

Then, became very interested in what would happen if live animals were part of the destruction.

So, next project was [Bacchanal](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/bacchanal-2010-12)

~An amazingly funny story about the opening of that exhibition that's too long to relate here~

Learnt an important lesson: Animals almost never behave the way you expect them to, and usually they do the exact opposite

After Bacchanal, learnt better  than to rely solely on nature guides to what animals will eat: For next project, did as much research on youtube watching vids of baboons eating pizza etc as reading nature papers on fruits, nuts etc are their natural diet

### [Picnic at Cape Point](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/picnic-at-cape-point-2012/1)

Went to set up picnic really early, but no baboons came. so packed up and drove around and found baboons - but along with a lot of tourists. so, dropped cakes on side of road and circled back to observe.

One tourist: "Oh My God that babooon just stole someone's birthday cake!"

I had managed to salvage something from this project but it wasn't the theatrical comedy I had imagine.

Because there are no longer divisions in our territories, we all share the same crippled space. We become companion species with animals. Food fuctions in her work as a metaphor for the ways in which the nature states are turned into culture

She tries to do justice with her animal collaborators in creating meaning together. Became a mediator in nature and culture, along with all the pitfalls and lessons learnt along the way.

Work now has two parts: field work, and in studio, where she edits video, creates sculptures and makes drawings.

Reflections on nature have affected the way she does her drawings. 

Previously, was very contorlled. didn't want any mistakes. Wanted it very tight.

But in watching animals, found so much beauty in vulnerability and unpredicatiblity in them. Projects that go wrong are the ones that have most feeling and are most memorable.

Now, she doesn't allow herself to spend so much energy making a perfect drawing. Just paper, paint and the most meaningful one minute sketches as possible. Even though they are full of chance marks, they didn't look like mistakes. They look free. She no longer had a headache after spending hours painting.

You have these preconceptions, and you *always* fall trap to anthrpomorphic thinking. It's so ingrained about how we think about nature that it's really hard to get past.

Denmark proejct: [The wild and the tamed](http://www.danasherwoodstudio.com/projects/the-wild-and-the-tame-2015/1)

Even though this project was a failure, it highlights something aboout wildness. there's something hopeful about animals just being animals. Converted field work into a sculpture+video installation

The consistent theme is control. Animals have their own subjectivity. We love nature, but the moment they come into our territory or encroach, we try to dominate and anthropomorphasise and control it.

## Papers: Making Culture Visible

Themes: hope, freedom, democracy and ownership.

### To Have and Have Not: Exploring Grammars of Sharing in the Context of Urban Mobility. 
_Anna Zavyalova • Stripe Partners_

Rooted in work with Renault-Nissan. Research carreid out in Sao Paulo, Ahmedabad, London

Paper focuses on pooled rides and perspective from riders. Infrastructure has 

Tensions that come up: **Private vs Public**

car was initially designed as a private space - affordances suggest privacy vs public transport designed to be shared. 

Also tension around aspirations, which differs from place to place. Some places it's about ownership, others is about arriving in a car.

Another tension: **Teleological vs Experiential**

It could be rational and make sense for people to pool resources and to share rides, but sometimes the determining factor is emotional and not rational. So thinking like: Rather be stuck in hot bus with no AC rather than carpool. 

Final tension: **Freedom and Ownership**

uncoupling of car as signifier of freedom. This is a generational thing. "You never forget your first car" - it's about coming of age.

But, for example in London with younger people - "Car is a responsibiltiy I don't want to bear" car=responsibiltiy and burden and stress.

Getting the grammar of sharing right: studying mobility through the eyes of drivers and passengres.

### Surveillance, Technology, and American Conceptions of Freedom
_Michael Griffin • Amazon_

Work came out of study on cameras + phsyical security information management systems at a school. (cameras, locks, speakers, etc all connected to a central command system). When installed - worked in deterring theft, alerting school admins to a person who needed help, etc

The director who had installed it experienced a school shooting. when speaking about the building security system, he said: "I think this technology enhances our freedom. That's just my thought."

What did he mean? 

Go back to panopticon: bentham and foucault. but in interviews, references were to 1984. 

Sometimes when companies install surveillance they say they don't want it to be obvious - no one wants to be Big Brother. But other times, it is made explicit, partly as a deterrance.

Most discussions of surveillance is grounded in belief that there is a trade off between freedom and security.
Actually often 4 dimensions
privacy security control and trust - they are signifiers but often go undefined: empty signifier

Ideology - imagined rations individulas hodl about their real( maerial) conditions of exitence; commons ense belieft

Marx described ideology as assemlages - imaginary, pure dream

Althuser: Interpellation - process by which individuals are hailed by, and thus made subject to, ideology. This is how ideology is formed.
e.g. when police calls out 'hey you!' person can't help but turn around.

going back to that phrase: "I think this technology enhances our freedom. That's just my thought." - what does that mean?

freedom:
valence - freedom to, or freedom from?
sense - social conditions (freedom to vote, economic freedom, fre)
entitlement - those who enjoys its blessings

Each of these sets up a different definition of freedom.

"Basically, security is freedom from danger" Metz

Freedom from death, trauma, danger etc

but even then, surveillance 

he himself has been hailed by an ideology that surveillance = freedom

### From the Mixed-Up-Files of A 21st-Century Librarian: Scales of Power, Conceptions of Democracy, and the Public Library
_Alannah Berson • University of Chicago_

are they still necessary
do they provide a service that can't be replaced by current technology?
how do we know what services they should provide? What do libraries do?

Internet+digitization: easy and cheap to keep records. also transfer of information (or goods) is cheaper - these lead to discussion of whether physical spaces like libraries+malls are still necessary.

They rarely do something so simple as providing a physical space for transmission of information 

What is the conception of the library in the 21st century?

Most poeple think of a quiet place. they think of librarians as professional shush-ers. they think of the encyclopaedia sets

What if we question these ideas? 

The reality of libraries is that they are not just there to help children learn 
they provide inforamtion to adults, and not just for infomration purposes - taxes, changes to local school curriculum, etc

They are also meeting places - places with toys for children while adults browse movies etc. 

some even lend out board games and fishing poles

Not all do but most use limited budget to figure out what local residence want or expect from libraries.

Notion of Chronotope - idea that time and space affect a person's character - becomes useful in analysing this.
