_Updated 28 October 2020_

I've [written previously](/newsgames/) about how games can help journalism find new ways to make people [care about the news](/need-for-news/) beyond the personal relevance and utility of information. I've been keeping an eye out for examples of newsgames ever since we started making [The Uber Game](https://ig.ft.com/uber-game/) in early 2017, and am really glad to see this becoming an ever-widening field with examples from both newsrooms, game studios and other places. 

This proliferation means that the boundaries between what is a newsgames, simulations, interactive explanation and interactive fiction is becoming increasingly blurred. And that, I think, is a good thing.

Paul Bradshaw [has a nice pinboard list](http://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:gamejournalism), and Ian Bogost's book, [Newsgames](http://bogost.com/books/newsgamesbook/), give a comprehensive overview. 

But in any case, here's the list I compiled. Apologies in advance for any I have missed, and please let me know about any omissions [@robinkwong](https://twitter.com/RobinKwong) on Twitter! 

I've also put together a ['Deep Dive'](https://refind.com/RobinKwong/newsgames) on Refind that's meant to be a guided introduction to newsgames and their role in journalism. [Check it out!](https://refind.com/RobinKwong/newsgames)
