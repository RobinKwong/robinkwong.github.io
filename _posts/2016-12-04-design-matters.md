Whenever anyone asks me for a podcast recommendation, I always suggest Debbie Millman's [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters) and its decade's worth of interviews with designers, writers, artists and other creative types.

Listening to them talk about their work and their careers has inspired me, not because of the particulars of their struggles and triumphs, but as a reminder that everyone encounters similar challenges and that it is possible to persevere. As David Bayles and Ted Orland wrote in *Art & Fear*:

> It won't help you to know exactly what Van Gogh needed to gain or lose in order to get on with his work. What is worth recognizing is that Van Gogh needed to gain or lose at all, that his work was no more or less inevitable than yours, and that he &mdash; like you &mdash; had only himself to fall back on.

So I wanted to finish listening to all 269 Design Matters episodes during my sabbatical. I thought I was most of the way there already, although I actually had no idea of my progress since I mosly jumped around listening to whichever episode seemed interesting at the time.

Time to build a database! The [Design Matters](http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters) site has a page for every episode, and you can navigate through it by search or filters: but no single place with the full listing.

I worte a simple webscraper used beautifulsoup to get the full list, and spent the better part of an afternoon going through the list manually to mark which ones I had already listened to (I likewise didn't have a full list of already-played episodes as I had used different devices and apps to listen to it).

**The bad news:** I've actually only listened to 86 out of 270 episodes

**The good news:** I've only already listened to 86 out of 270 episodes
