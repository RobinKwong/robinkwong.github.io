I spoke to Francesco Zaffarano about our team of creative producers' plans and goals for 2019.

I noted that, having laid the foundations for the completely new team last year, the focus this year will be on making an impact and shifting newsroom culture. Apart from the daily work of improving the digital presentation of our articles, we'll primarily focus on further developing our set of templates for new formats - the 'Story Playbook'; bringing data-informed decision-making onto the news desks through weekly analytics reports, and helping spread knowledge through the newsroom with editorial lightning talks.
