I'm back for another day of EPIC. My notes for Monday's sessions are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-one))

## Friction in Sustainability Transitions: Lessons From Organizations and Institutions
_Professor of Management & Organizations, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University_

The temporal dynamic of how we get to a better world that's more sustainable, and the central role that organizations play in facilitating that path forward.

Global warming chart - two things to take away from it. 1 is that it is dire. what we take today others in the future will have to pay for. 2 is that the kink in the 1.5 degree line implies a sharp shift and transition from the current trajectory. So how can we make those transitions in a short timeframe?

when we think of sustainability we cannot stop at climate, circularity, and clean water. we have to include social equity, peace, education, etc - in a holistic way. "an overall way to change the way we run our economy to get to a new equilibrium"

they are all interconnected. Using climate as an example because there is good data for it

There's a body of work that looks at relatively short time shifts

scaling doesn't happen automatically, it happens when all those forces come together - this then leads to change being ingrained.

We typically think of this as an S shaped curve - lots of foundation building work initially, hit tipping point then rapid acceleration; then hits lock in point where you can't go back.

This is the typical model for thinking about transitions, but in reality there's friction during the process. what if it looks like these curves instead?

When this happens we blame friction. i.e. the logic of the S curve assumes that acceleration is automatic. 

But empirical research shows that actually all these curves happen all the time. So why/how come/what explains these differences?

Main point: these differences happen from frictions between the different temporal/pace layers of an organization system.

"tension is the equivalent to friction in a static way"

The analogy of different 'temporal strucutres' in an org is like that of different pace layers of a building. The site is long-term, stuff inside the house turns over much quicker. 

The different pace layers of energy transition:

Normally we think fo organizations as a heirarchy. You can also think of organizations across three layers / faces: Activities, meaning and power:

Focusing on the 'culture' face of it: there's a tension between the urgency of issue and how long it takes to change culture.

Culture is layered too. think of culture not as one thing but a temporal structuree with many layers.

note: interesting that the different temporal layers i.e. fast->slow mirrors layering of explicit->implicit

What does sustainability culture look like? Sustainability often framed around initiatives and activities, and not as embedded culture.

"My take of it is that we have no concrete example of what it looks like" - i.e. no org has achieved it and therefore sustainablty is a proejction of a distant future. 

This is important because imagination, visioning, futuring, etc is very different from 'what we are doing now' in terms of how we approach it. It's also psychologially distant. 4 elements of psychological distance: 

So Q is - what WOULD be an ideal sustainability culture look like?

Took semiotic approach in setting up opposition between sustainable vs unsustainable. translate that into different aspects:

note: ok, but if we're starting from present reality and thinking of the ideal in opposition to it, are we limiting our imagination? this feels like a 'negative'/reactive approach to defining sustainability 

Assuming the above frameworks/models, what are the srouces of friction?

1. Friction from change ith dissonance between pace layers.

The reason why the changes happening at the faster layers are not translating into changes at slower layer is because of boundary friction: basically, culture is slow to change (but this chart goes some way to explain why)

If you want to 'notice' these frictions: look for Failed interaction rituals, conflict, resistance, polarization, reversals inaction and decoupling.


2. Friction from Intervention with naive projection

i.e. unrealistic expectations. This happens because of psychological distance - long term projective ideal is more theorized, abstract, simple, etc. Details/breaking this down:

"Our imagination is based on ideologies, desired identities and principles"

side note: this point has implications for solutions journalism, future-based journalism, journalism that sparks imagination, etc and helps explain the tension between those and 'traditional' journalism. 

Ethnogrpahic approaches to sustainability transformations can help - by ethnographic, mean simply very concrete, very grounded, very community-engaged approaches. i.e. bring realism back.


Common responses to reducing friction:

- increase power - but problem of passive compliance and risk of countermobilization. the more you push for sustainability the more you make it a political issue

- increase choice: (i.e. you dont have to do it / do it it this way; do it your own way) problem of scaling and questions of equity


Better response: embracing friction

- pacing: timing intervention to watershed moments/fulcrum points/moments when the different cycles match up

- recognition and stakeholder dialogue in design and implementation
