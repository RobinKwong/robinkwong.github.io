I'm back for another day of EPIC. My notes for Monday's sessions are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-one))

## Friction in Sustainability Transitions: Lessons From Organizations and Institutions
_Professor of Management & Organizations, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University_

The temporal dynamic of how we get to a better world that's more sustainable, and the central role that organizations play in facilitating that path forward.

Global warming chart - two things to take away from it. 1 is that it is dire. what we take today others in the future will have to pay for. 2 is that the kink in the 1.5 degree line implies a sharp shift and transition from the current trajectory. So how can we make those transitions in a short timeframe?

when we think of sustainability we cannot stop at climate, circularity, and clean water. we have to include social equity, peace, education, etc - in a holistic way. "an overall way to change the way we run our economy to get to a new equilibrium"

they are all interconnected. Using climate as an example because there is good data for it

There's a body of work that looks at relatively short time shifts

scaling doesn't happen automatically, it happens when all those forces come together - this then leads to change being ingrained.

We typically think of this as an S shaped curve - lots of foundation building work initially, hit tipping point then rapid acceleration; then hits lock in point where you can't go back.

This is the typical model for thinking about transitions, but in reality there's friction during the process. what if it looks like these curves instead?

When this happens we blame friction. i.e. the logic of the S curve assumes that acceleration is automatic. 

But empirical research shows that actually all these curves happen all the time. So why/how come/what explains these differences?

Main point: these differences happen from frictions between the different temporal/pace layers of an organization system.

"tension is the equivalent to friction in a static way"

The analogy of different 'temporal strucutres' in an org is like that of different pace layers of a building. The site is long-term, stuff inside the house turns over much quicker. 

The different pace layers of energy transition:

Normally we think fo organizations as a heirarchy
