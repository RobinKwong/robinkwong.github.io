These are my notes for the second day of the [Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference](https://2021.epicpeople.org/), which is taking place virtually this year.

My notes for day one [are here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/)


## Catching up to the Present to Reimagine the Future

_In the age of pandemics and climate crises, reality is represented via varied narratives on health, politics, and the environment across different cultural and social contexts. As artists, designers, and ethnographers practicing the art of narration within different specialties and contexts, this panel aims to showcase how creative professionals re-organize their methods, practices, relationships, and lives in the face of present circumstances. Panelists will share how art and design can help us reflect upon the present and address any future challenges._

### Chuma
Artist and designer from Lagos. Work revolves around identity. Has three platforms: social enterprise, afro-centric products, cultural events.

In Africa, we had a different way to record history

His works are reminiscent of the age-old curvilinear Igbo ‘Uli Artform’ and created through a synthesis of traditional and digital techniques. This hybrid art making technique has positioned Chuma’s works to feature naturally both in print and emerging NFT art spaces.

### Rasa & Ratis

from Riga. Works with science and emerging media with a focus on sensory and perceptual aspects.  

http://smitesmits.com/

Our human stories have always been mediated and the limits of our senses have always been replaced by technology. But with pandemic and lockdown there's a need to find ways to renew our focus on sensory works and embodied experiences

eg. battery that sonifies bactierical activity in a pond; atmospheric forest - visualizing the relationship between forest and atmosphere

a lot of their work is out in the field / in nature. mainly works with the inivisible in nature 

have been working for 20 years. were pioneering internet radio artist.

### Natascha

normally in London. Writes about research, and often lesser-known figures in history. but wanted to share piece of speculative fiction

## Designing Emergent Products and Services

_Ethnographers must use insights about the consumers of current products and services in order to anticipate future ones. In this session, researchers demonstrate how they do this such diverse contexts as immersive media, virtual primary care, and future vehicles._

*Building for the Future, Together: A Model for Bringing Emerging Products to Market, Using Anticipatory Ethnography and Mixed Methods Research*
_Stefanie Hutka, Adobe, Inc._

Defining emergent technology as bringing significant change to business industry or society, primary impact occurs in the future, and where market research products is largely undefined.

Case study on designing an AR creation app - Adobe Arrow

But most customers have never used an AR creation app.

13 participants - all creative professionals - for one on one in person research sessions.

Gave them a photo of an otherwise empty apartment, clear acrylic sheet, and markers - how would you make the ordinary seem extraordinary? 

Prompt adapted from a 2017 medium article on designing on emergent technologies.  

Kept the prompt/exercise away from the term AR or glasses or specific tech solutions.

This approach - termed anticipatory ethnography - situataes participants in a future in which the emerging technology exists to understand what they value in the future

This example illustrates how a researcher can address the challenge of helping a team anticipate how potential customers want to use an emerging product. 

But bigger challenge is how to foster more active engagement between the product team and potential customers in these situations. 

Solution was to categorise open-ended responses together, as a team. She then also coded a subset of the responses on her own as a point of reference.

Remote ethnographic study done by Rightpoint and GM on the experiences and needs of passengers and drivers during covid. 

Pandemic changed driver + passenger experience and needs, but how to research that when it's impossible for researchers to be in the backseat of a car to observe? Ended up doing a remote diary study over a period of seven weeks from August 2020 to October 2020

Recruitment took into account factors like health status, emotional sensitivity to cover 19 are buying status and Even employment

The experience of a driver and a passenger, even when in the same car together, can be really different (depending on whether they feel like they have control over the environment). This is really different from past conception of the car as an extension of personal space.  

Asked participants to show their car cleaning routine in video. only about 11% showed actions to improve air quality. Many didn't realize that existing car features like air filtering can help risk reduction.

Also only realised afterwards that interest in air filtration was mainly driven by wildfires, rather than covid. Helped answer one question GM had around how long these new attitudes were here to stay.

Three outcomes/implications:

1. Growing interest in advanced, self sanitizing surfaces.

2. Mobile+digital screens create a sense of agency not just for drivers but also for passengers.

3. These attitudes are here to stay. Changes driven not just by covid but also by climate change.

Tips for remote research:

1. Design for flexibility and give yourself more time and space

2. Involve stakeholders early and often

3. Look for opportunities to pair qual with quant

4. Use a variety of stimuli to control for bias 


*Designing Virtual Primary Health Care*
_Marie Mika, Grand Rounds, Inc.
Arvind Venkataramani, Sonic Rim_

Covid necessitated a co-ordinated effort to deliver virtual care, and accelerated underlying trend towards more online/virtual care.

VPC = virtual primary care.

What keeps people from engaging in primary care, which is low and trending lower in the US? and how could VPC help change that?

Initial assumption was that VPC would be most useful in rural areas. and inversely, there would be less need/desire for VPC in urban areas.

original assumptions around rural/urban were mostly actually around low or high social economic status.

But not only was that original hypotheses debunked, they were found to be insufficient. In that they did not account for any kind of distrust or skepticism in primary care, in and of itself.

People with lower social economic status often do not see institutionalized healthcare, much less primary care, as valuable or trustworthy. So even though they saw virtual care as more convenient, it did not offset the other factors such as seeing VPC as a diminished form of in person care. 

and reverse for people with higher social-economic status - who did now view care with dread, and saw VPC as something that was in its infancy but will continue ot get better.  The positive experiences they had paved the way for greater anticipation of VPC.

"Not only is the future unevenly distributed, it is also unevenly desired."
