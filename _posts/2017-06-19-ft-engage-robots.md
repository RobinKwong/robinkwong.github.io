I spoke at an FT panel discussion on June 19 about the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on jobs, drawing from what I learnt while I was in San Francisco for the [Nikkei-FT fellowship programme](/fellowship/).

I argued that the challenge of automation is as much about management and the way we work as it was about skills and knowledge. I also believe that we need to revalue emotional and relational labour, as those are things that humans are uniquely good at.
