I was really honoured to have been invited to this panel discussion together with New York Times National Editor Marc Lacy and Brazilian Editor Marta Gleich, Director of Journalism Newspapers & Radio at Grupo RBS, talking about innovative approaches to reporting and engaging with audiences during the Covid pandemic. 

I spoke about some of our efforts to center the voices of people affected by the panedmic, and how we make sure that our journalism is of utility and is easily accesible to people.

The panel was hosted by Tow Center Director Professor Emily Bell, and ICFJâ€™s Global Director of Research, Dr. Julie Posetti. It was part of [a larger research collaboration](https://www.icfj.org/research-journalism-and-covid-19) between ICFJ and the Tow Center at Columbia University.
