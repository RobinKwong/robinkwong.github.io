I'm at the [AdventureX conference](http://www.adventurexpo.org/) this weekend. These are the notes

## Dave Gilbert

Keeping your focus: how to keep your project grounded and realistic and within a manageable scope

Great thing about being indie is that you can create whataver you want, but that blessing can be a bit of a burden sometimes.

With no oversight, could get overwhelmed by possibilities, or get stuck on a small trivial detail.

How do you direct yourself and give yourself a compass that can keep you on the right path?

Building to an emotional theme: GDC talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao4b4aN7RgE

3 step process:
Vision
Critique
Revision

### Vision: 

What are your goals?

Before you can figure out what your goals are, you have to be honest with yourself and figure out what you are capable of and where your strengths and weaknesses are.

For example: The Blackwell series

The overarching story can be a bit of a mess. There are plot holes in the back story etc

BUT - this was not a problem. becuase that's not wher ethe focus of the game is. the main focus, and objective, was always around the protagonist's interaction with the lost ghosts

Usually this enables him to get back on the right track, but not always.

So need a secondary focus: Rosa and Joey

By approaching it from a new angle, usually enough to get back to where Ineeded to be. so needed a 3rd focus:

the game itself 

sometimes that's not enough, so, 4th focus:

the whole series.

So, when people say that the backstory and the overarching meta-narrative is a bit of a mess, that's because it's at the bottom of the priority list.

Backstory and world-building are probably the things I'm the lest good at. my strengths are in writing about people and covnersations. sure, want to push myself, but it would be dumb to make worldbuidling my main focus. would quickly get myself into the frustration zone.

### Critique: 

you want to get things playable as soon as possible, and get to a prototype as soon as possible.  

stick figures, placeholder dialogue, whatever it takes to get it out of your head and into a prototype. lots of advantages from testers:

- get feedback early and can adjust course
- if you can get them emotionally engaged even when the game looks unpolished, you know you're onto something and that can give you an emotional jolt to keep going.
- conversations and back and forth with the testers. Being an indie game developer can be a lonely thing.

### Revision

uses example of this section of game, set in Staten Island - feedback from testers was negative. it was boring and hard to know why they should care.

thought about what goal of the section was and why you were on staten island: realised that, true goal of the section was to make the player like Vicky, so had to re-evaluate approach.

- gave her more screentime. 
- have her help you fight a sea monster
- etc

Refocused writing of the scene around the idea that every section of the scene and moment in the game had to tell you who vicky was and help you like her.

In this talk, spoke a lot about motivation and confidence: often why it takes so long to make these games is that i'm extremely unceratin about which direction to take next. know that my reputation and livelihood are on the line. So, one of the reasons why focus is necessary is because this helps give motivation and confidence to keep going.

It's much better to expand your comfort zone than to try to really get out of it. Just as important to make sure you don't land yourself in the frustration zone.
