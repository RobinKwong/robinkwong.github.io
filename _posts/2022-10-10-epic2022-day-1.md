Very excited to once again be back among friends at [EPIC](https://2022.epicpeople.org/) (still one of the best conferences around).

I'll try to take live notes as in previous years. Here's my notes from EPIC [2021](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/), [2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018-summary/) and [2017](https://robinkwong.com/epic-day-four/)

## Keynote: Payal Arora
