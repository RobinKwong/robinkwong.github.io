I'm very excited to once again be back among friends at [EPIC](https://2022.epicpeople.org/) (still one of the best conferences around). And this time in Amsterdam as well!

I'll try to take live notes as I have in previous years. Here are my notes from EPIC [2021](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/), [2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018-summary/) and [2017](https://robinkwong.com/epic-day-four/)

## Keynote: Payal Arora (@3Lmantra)

_Payal Arora is a digital anthropologist, a TEDx speaker, and an author of award-winning books, including ‘The Next Billion Users’ with Harvard Press. Her expertise lies in user experience in the global south, digital inequality, and inclusive design. Forbes named her the “next billion champion” and the “right kind of person to reform tech.” She is a Professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Co-Founder of FemLab, a future of work initiative._

The next billion creatives - who are they, what they want and what this says about resilience.  

Next billion: Primarily young people outside of the west. Low but rising income. Digitally native because mobile phones and data plans have become extraordinarily cheap. 

Lots of companies interested in them and in setting up 'next billion labs' - viewpoint primarily extractive "data is the new oil" but there's an opportunity for co-creation instead of seeing them as data points

Global south is already normative. US fewer than 1 in 15 of the world's internet users, 'next web' is China + India

Not just scale - also intensity. Average kid in China spending twice the time online as the kid in the US

BUT - Rest of world still looks at this in specific (old-school) ways: 

For industry and companies, the prototype user is anglo-saxon oriented. It may not be how to slice up physical territory in Africa / South Asia, but how to slice up digital infrastructure and data ownership. This sliced up approach leads to silo-ed approache approach and teams not talking to each other

For aid agencies, the approach is still utility-driven. Leads to pilotitis, a graveyard of apps

For govts, prototype user is nationalistic oriented. This is a new phenomenon in global south. basically a reaction to and doubling down against the data extraction model. instead a big focus on data localization and sovereignty. But this ignores the reality that we are in a global political economy.

The pyramid of needs (maslow's heirarchy) has been debunked for ages but still is used to approach tech in global south. 

But what we need to do is to invert the pyramid. These usere are driven by factors beyond utility. They see digital as a space for self-actualization. For so long they have been invisible and dehumanised. (instead of maslow's heirarchy), they are driven by joy, pleasure, sociability, romance - modes that remind them to humanize and self actualise. 

Another myth is 'trickle down' innovation. i.e. that west leads in tech and global south lags. No longer true in many fields i.e. edtech, fintech, etc 

Creativity is resilience. "Jugaad" - Hacking with scarce and limited resources - concept that exists in many cultures.

Founded Femlab to investigate what is this creativity and innovation. What constitutes digital creativity? Looked at where it happens and among what groups - basically separating out six different actors in the 'creative economy' or 'influencer economy'.

Then looked at process and requirements of digital creativity. For example, accessibility:

These constraints leads to, for example, India being a hub because there's a belief that if we can design for this particulalry constrained market, we can design for the rest of global south (relfects a flattening of the GS) Also leads to e.g. designing one-stop-shop suites of apps.

Privacy also matters - but less about privacy from platform as personal privacy (i.e. i use insta but my parents don't know)

Tiktok Indian Flippers with millions of views - this is not a need that you have or know about as a viewer. but is born out of constraint of resources but then opened up genres and markets

"Their process is their product"

It's not about being the owner of this particular product or service. but rather it's about co-creation because it's the strategy twoards 

The end goal is community building through the creative process, so the exact product or content or service matters less. 

changing relationship with technology - use what's easy to them. no longer mindset that they should or need to step up to learn how to use something that's intimidating. they want to create easily and casually, on the go.

This means that templates are a big deal: 

![](/images/epic2022/IMG_0648.jpg)

"Users want to be original but they also want to fit in." Template allows them to be MORE creative because they can focus on the content.

"Visibility is king" - no point in creating if cannot publish and be seen because it is an extension of their self-identity and self-expression

Remixing and reviving old trends is important because you don't always have something to say.

Niche is scalable: candle making, travel logging, etc. the mundanity of the content (flipping, getting pet to eat, etc) makes the content relatable beyond language.

On data and privacy: They are aware but are also hyper risk takers. Partly due to already living in a surveillance community off-line (family, teachers, state, etc)

What this leads to: being plagarised or being seen as having plagarised is inevitable. Plagarism seen as praise

User Framework for creativity. Typically splits into Creativity as Instrument vs Creativity as Passion. Creativity as Passion model is then split into: Access, Learning, Process, Expression, Data.

Next Billion sees creativity as instrumental, which has very different implication for those categories.

For resilience, we need to build intrinsically global products and services. Don't fall into US thinking of "rest of world" - i.e. rest of world doesn't matter - or European fortress mindset - says the right thing but fundamentally tries to protect own 'fortress' (which ignores their global supply chain dependencies)

## Talking Resilience: The Transformative Power of Shared Narratives (Concertzaal)
_Curators: Letizia Nardi, InProcess and Gigi Taylor, Indeed_

The contributions in this session highlight the power of collaborative, dialectic narratives in unpacking resilience. Through humor, storytelling, visualization and linguistic craft, these contributions offer insight into various lenses that we can use to examine the work we do and the footprint it leaves on others and ourselves.
