I'm very excited to once again be back among friends at [EPIC](https://2022.epicpeople.org/) (still one of the best conferences around). And this time in Amsterdam as well!

I'll try to take live notes as I have in previous years. Here are my notes from EPIC [2021](https://robinkwong.com/epic2021-day-one/), [2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018-summary/) and [2017](https://robinkwong.com/epic-day-four/)

## Keynote: Payal Arora (@3Lmantra)

_Payal Arora is a digital anthropologist, a TEDx speaker, and an author of award-winning books, including ‘The Next Billion Users’ with Harvard Press. Her expertise lies in user experience in the global south, digital inequality, and inclusive design. Forbes named her the “next billion champion” and the “right kind of person to reform tech.” She is a Professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Co-Founder of FemLab, a future of work initiative._

The next billion creatives - who are they, what they want and what this says about resilience.  

Next billion: Primarily young people outside of the west. Low but rising income. Digitally native because mobile phones and data plans have become extraordinarily cheap. 

Lots of companies interested in them and in setting up 'next billion labs' - viewpoint primarily extractive "data is the new oil" but there's an opportunity for co-creation instead of seeing them as data points

Global south is already normative. US fewer than 1 in 15 of the world's internet users, 'next web' is China + India

Not just scale - also intensity. Average kid in China spending twice the time online as the kid in the US

BUT - Rest of world still looks at this in specific (old-school) ways: 

For industry and companies, the prototype user is anglo-saxon oriented. It may not be how to slice up physical territory in Africa / South Asia, but how to slice up digital infrastructure and data ownership. This sliced up approach leads to silo-ed approache approach and teams not talking to each other

For aid agencies, the approach is still utility-driven. Leads to pilotitis, a graveyard of apps

For govts, prototype user is nationalistic oriented. This is a new phenomenon in global south. basically a reaction to and doubling down against the data extraction model. instead a big focus on data localization and sovereignty. But this ignores the reality that we are in a global political economy.

The pyramid of needs (maslow's heirarchy) has been debunked for ages but still is used to approach tech in global south. 

But what we need to do is to invert the pyramid. These usere are driven by factors beyond utility. They see digital as a space for self-actualization. For so long they have been invisible and dehumanised. (instead of maslow's heirarchy), they are driven by joy, pleasure, sociability, romance - modes that remind them to humanize and self actualise. 

Another myth is 'trickle down' innovation. i.e. that west leads in tech and global south lags. No longer true in many fields i.e. edtech, fintech, etc 

Creativity is resilience. Hacking with scarce and limited resources - concept that exists in many cultures.

Founded Femlab to investigate what is this creativity and innovation. What constitutes digital creativity? Looked at where it happens and among what groups - basically separating out six different actors in the 'creative economy' or 'influencer economy'.

Then looked at process and requirements of digital creativity. For example, accessibility:
