The short answer is: "Yeah, pretty good."

The long answer is the rest of this post

## Three things a sabbatical is good for

I went into my sabbatical thinking: "Finally. Now that I don't have to go into the office for the next six weeks, I'm going to get so much done." 

But now that it is drawing to an end, I realise that's not really what sabbaticals are for at all. Work is for producing output; sabbaticals are for digesting input.

I think there are three useful things you could do to 'digest input' during a sabbatical:
 
### Widen your internal and external circles

I know it sounds like crazy hippie talk, but I do think there is something to the idea of expanding your consciousness and being more [open to allowing genius to descend upon your work](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius/transcript?language=en).

As David Lynch wrote, ideas are like fish: "Little fish swim on the surface, but the big ones swim down below. If you can expand the container you're fishing in &mdash; your consciousness &mdash; you can catch bigger fish."

How do you expand that container, that internal circle? For me, meditation helps. Spending time with people that matter to me helps. Writing about it, as I am doing so now, helps. These are specific techniques, for which your mileage may vary, but the point is that they all facilitate a better understanding of who you are and why you do what you do. 

This needs to be complemented by taking in outside stimuli to expand your external circle. Use your sabbatical to read, watch, listen or play. Go to conferences for industries adjacent to the fields you work in, and be a neophyte there. Acquire new literary or cultural heroes.

### Check your trajectory

As [Stefan Sagmeister says](https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/stefan-sagmeister), sabbaticals are the best strategy "to make sure that what I do remains a calling and doesn't deteriorate into a job, or into career".

Use the time to reflect and make sure you're on the right track. Ask yourself: 

- Are you still learning new things? 
- What is the work you would do if you had your dream job? 
- What's stopping you from doing that work now?

Make course adjustments as necessary.

### Form new habits

If you are really determined to do something productive during your sabbatical, I can think of nothing else that would have more impact than to (try to) form a new habit.

Habits are powerful. They're difficult to form consciously, but [it can be done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMbsGBlpP30). Going on sabbatical gives you an abrupt change from your daily routine, and a continuous chunk of uninterrupted time &mdash; conditions conducive to forming new habits. 

But even then, it's not easy to do. I started exercising daily, but struggled at meditating daily, even though I'm more convinced of the benefits of the latter than the the former. Keeping it going beyond my sabbatical is a challenge I'm looking forward to.

## Assorted wisdom I picked up

The thing about meditation is: You become more and more *you*

<p class="quote-attrib"><em>David Lynch</em></p>

Everyone needs a place. It shouldn't be inside of someone else

<p class="quote-attrib"><em>Richard Siken, via Sarah Kay</em></p>

To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest. To live fully is to be always in no-man's land, to experience each moment as completely new and fresh. To live is to be willing to die over and over again.

And there he was, dreaming about the future. It looked bright and right and ready for him. There was no scary mystery to it and it was right around the corner.

Then Brás wroke up and realized that, when you turn that corner, that future you have written and wished for is not always there waiting for you. In fact, it usually isn't at all what you expected &hellip; Around the corner there is just another big annoying question mark.

It's called life.

<p class="quote-attrib"><em>Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá</em></p>

Life is a lot like Carcassone. Don't spent your life bellyaching about a meeple you could've popped off the board if only you drew the right piece. That's absurd.

<p class="quote-attrib"><em>Robin Hunicke</em></p>

Your reach as a viewer is vastly greater than your reach as a maker &hellip; The surprising (and probably disturbing) corollary to this is that we don't learn much about making art from being moved by it.

<p class="quote-attrib"><em>David Bayles &amp; Ted Orland</em></p>

Look, I understand that inside me there is a greedy, gluttonous, lazy, hippie &mdash; you know? I understand that free time is probably my enemy. That if I’m given too much free time to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, I’m afraid of that inner hippie emerging. There’s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, and smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons, and old movies. I could easily do that. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy.
