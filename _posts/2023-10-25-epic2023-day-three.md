Can't believe it's already the last day of EPIC. The conference theme this year is friction, but for me it's been a few days of productive encounters that have sparked creativity and fostered connections. 

My notes for Monday's sessions are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-one) Notes for Tuesday are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-two)

## Seismic Shifts or Seasonal Patterns: After a Tough Year for Research, Do We Need Fundamental Change, or Just Patience?

Note: these are not going to be verbatim

tough year with lots of trauma and uncertainty between layoffs and AI.

there was a previous EPIC theme of renewal and that needs to be how we approach this. cannot be passive and sit back. 

Is this just a cycle and we can wait for it to pass, or is this a reckoning that changes our role in orgs - L leans towards the latter.

Set ourselves up in a way that makes eour contribution to the business much more clear - how do we make sure that our work is being registered in all the ways that programme management registers work. In terms of claiming wins, can't just be like, "oh we influenced the roadmap". we need to instead track longitudinal impact.
