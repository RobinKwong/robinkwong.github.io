Can't believe it's already the last day of EPIC. The conference theme this year is friction, but for me it's been a few days of productive encounters that have sparked creativity and fostered connections. 

My notes for Monday's sessions are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-one). Notes for Tuesday are [here](https://robinkwong.com/epic2023-day-two)

## Seismic Shifts or Seasonal Patterns: After a Tough Year for Research, Do We Need Fundamental Change, or Just Patience?

Note: these are not going to be verbatim

tough year with lots of trauma and uncertainty between layoffs and AI.

there was a previous EPIC theme of renewal and that needs to be how we approach this. cannot be passive and sit back. 

Is this just a cycle and we can wait for it to pass, or is this a reckoning that changes our role in orgs - L leans towards the latter.

Set ourselves up in a way that makes eour contribution to the business much more clear - how do we make sure that our work is being registered in all the ways that programme management registers work. In terms of claiming wins, can't just be like, "oh we influenced the roadmap". we need to instead track longitudinal impact.

The theme of reclamation is useful - how do we gather everything we've got to synthesise and spot patterns and tell stories from what already exists? Don't necessarily need to spend money and go out to do new research. We as a community have taken our eyes off distillation.

anecdote from L of how they actually had a librarian on the team who could pull out all the relevant previous research reports, but to an executive, that was basically the same as having nothing becuase the exec wasn't going to read through all 17 reports and do their own synthesis. Would rather start afresh instead.

the next step from that is to repeatedly communicate the same three things until the org 'gets it'

Q for S - what does building out a data science team look like. A: it takes a lot of time to build it up, and needs a lot of bridge building between different disciplines. It feels fresh. 

Communities have boundaries, but we need to continue to push the adjacencies. EPIC has been on a trajectory of growth but that can lead to inward conversations. 

L at Atlassian there has been several reorgs - reserach was with CX, then marketing, then engineering.
