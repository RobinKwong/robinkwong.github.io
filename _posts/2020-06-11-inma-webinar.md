I spoke to about 40 people at a webinar hosted by the International News Media Association about some of our team's recent projects. I talked about how we work collaboratively with reporters, editors, and other engineering teams, and delved into some of the broader challenges facing newsroom innovation teams.

There is both a [video recording](https://www.inma.org/webinar-detail.cfm?w=131) and a [written summary](https://www.inma.org/blogs/conference/post.cfm/wall-street-journal-shares-4-steps-toward-reinventing-newsroom-innovation) of the event, but it is only available to INMA members.
