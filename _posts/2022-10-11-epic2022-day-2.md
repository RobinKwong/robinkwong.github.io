## Keynote: Kurt Ward

_Kurt Ward is a Senior Design Director at Philips Healthcare, based in the Netherlands. His goal is to design sustainable and adaptable health systems by redefining the social determinants of health and reframing humanityâ€™s relationship with the natural world_

Challenge: Rethink how we think about health and ecosystems; to rethink how we think

Have been at Philips Design for 22 years. About five to six years ago realised he was part of old guard, and needed to devleop his coaching and mentoring skills. 

"How did I learn how to think?" - not just theory of epistemology but the practical act of thinking.

History of how we've done and think about healthcare at Philips:

Twenty years ago, Philips focused mainly on product design - usability qualities, patient interaction quality, brand and product etc.

Had lots of great product designers: They were artesans.

At the same time, embraced ethnography over last 30 years: everything needed to be based around people's insights. people-orient. The product is just one aspect of this - patient and clinicians are parts of it too. Patient goes through an anxiety-ridden experience
