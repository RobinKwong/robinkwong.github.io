## Keynote: Kurt Ward

_Kurt Ward is a Senior Design Director at Philips Healthcare, based in the Netherlands. His goal is to design sustainable and adaptable health systems by redefining the social determinants of health and reframing humanityâ€™s relationship with the natural world_

Challenge: Rethink how we think about health and ecosystems; to rethink how we think

Have been at Philips Design for 22 years. About five to six years ago realised he was part of old guard, and needed to devleop his coaching and mentoring skills. 

"How did I learn how to think?" - not just theory of epistemology but the practical act of thinking.

History of how we've done and think about healthcare at Philips:

Twenty years ago, Philips focused mainly on product design - usability qualities, patient interaction quality, brand and product etc.

Had lots of great product designers: They were artesans.

At the same time, embraced ethnography over last 30 years: everything needed to be based around people's insights. people-orient. The product is just one aspect of this - patient and clinicians are parts of it too. Patient goes through an anxiety-ridden experience. How do we improve that? Maybe use animation, sound? Maybe support workflow of staff? resulted in creating the first ambient healthcare design. This worked - patient experience score improved, as did staff experience and outcomes: More people you can process, more people you can treat. 

Moving from product -> holistic patient experience.

Could we apply this to the entire radiology experience? Moved to working with architects to redsign the entire hospital building as well.

Next step: can we do this on a country level? Did that with seven counties in Kenya

In addition to service design, there were also medical technology improvements that led to other transformations as well.

Should say: I have one of the best jobs in the world, at one of the best companies in the world that cares about societal impact as well as biz outcomes. 

BUT

The current state of healthcare: most healthcare systems around the world are under extreme stress. extreme shortage of clinical and non-clinincal staff. Existing staff are burnt out. "Who's caring for the carers". In Europe, there is unforseen new energy costs to the tune of hundred of millions of dollars.

Healthcare cost rising from 9% of GDP several years ago to 14% (by 2030

Carbon footprint: 5-10% of a country's footprint comes from healathcare. Sometimes greater than transport   

Populations are increasing at a rate we never foresaw. Also aging rapidly.

45% of population has chronic disease. Some have 5 or more 

2022 growing % of world wihtout access to any immediate medical care. Not just remote places but also in rural america. Some hospitals in Canada closing ER on certain days because they do not have enough staff.

Inequitable access to vaccines and healthcare.

This leads me to question that over the last 20 years, we have been [wrongly] focused on individual interventions.    

This systems, clock-work view of life began with Descartes

Descartes's systems view of the man as independent of nature and can be understood mechanisitically. If we are to understand some things, we need to break it down into individual smaller pieces. Our discoveries in DNA probably comes from that worldview.

But - When do we enter the healthcare system? When we show a symptom of a disease or potential disease. This means our health system is designed in two ways: by specialites and mostly funded, staffed, and organised around you already being sick or an illness. Where does this leave us with the ability to think holistically about organic life to prevent or avoid entering the system in the first place

If you take a Cartesian view of the body, why would you consider the microbiome in our guts? They are not produced by the body.

From the microbiome to sunlight (our Circadean rhythm), to air, we exist within and are interrelated with multiple systems 

2021: 3.1m ppl died from covid; 4m died from air pollution-related diseases

Team from Japan monitored glucose level of diabetics, and asked them to do a forest walk for 3km-5km. Afterwards, glucose level reduced by 40%.   

~~

We need to think about health in a more holistic way instead of in a symptom-based or "-ology" way. This need is independent from natural disasters, pandemic and war

How do we do a major transformation? We're not going to be able to tear the whole system apart, so how do we adapt it?

Could we look at people across their lifetime instead of just when they are sick?

Taking this further, could we create a 'digital twin' or simulation of you that can do two things: 1) help inform your personal choices to make you healthier overall, and 2) support the health system to provide integrative care?

Data privacy issues and infringement of rights are important issues for this vision and needs to be solved. Encouraging behavioural change is also difficult. We're nowhere near this being possible at the moment. 

We need to think of health holistically from a mental health, ecological, 

We have a duty to help our stakeholders and the world to think holistically. Help them consider a broader systems view when scoping. i.e. in agriculture project, think about animal rights
