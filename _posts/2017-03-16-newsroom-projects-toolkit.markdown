Nearly a year ago I [set myself a goal](/build-bot-take-job/): To create a tool that will help other Financial Times editors become better at running series of stories, and managing digital projects.

This desire was born out of my belief that newsroom change is less about new technology, business models, or skills than it is about introducing new culture and workflow.

I overran my initial 3-month deadline by quite a bit, and the idea that this tool would take the form of a bot was always a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the FT's special projects toolkit is now live and [publicly available](https://github.com/ft-interactive/projects-toolkit/).

I wrote about the thinking behind it, and also the reasons why we made it open source, [in this article](https://source.opennews.org/articles/ikea-inspired-workflow/) for Source Opennews.
