## Doing Design Research in a Cognitive World

### What does AI mean to you?

_Dawn Nafus - Intel_
AI: Discursive and engineering
Discursive - where it's at is v early stage and eveyrone has to have an opinion

See two directions:
- An opportunity for us to do slow data. Really spend time with the input data that goes into the machine learning algorithms

- Sharpen our instincts with respect to the kinds of jobs we say yes to vs the jobs we say no to. Who do we enable to control the data and the narrative 

_Christian Madsbjerg - ReD Associates_

There's almost a death wish in the technology world: "If only we could build a machine that could generate truth, then we can stop thinking."

With the computers we have now, we could feed it 40m pictures of dog and it would know what a dog looks like. but i can do that with one picture with my daughter. I'm more interested in people.

We're under-indexing on understanding people and over-indexing on understanding machines.

I just think we should spend a bit more time observing the world rather than looking at a screen.

_Melissa Cefkin - Nissan Research Centre_

_Mark Burrellâ€”Watson Health, IBM_
70s and 80s, lots of discussion about not just artificial intelligence but more generally about what intelligence is. 

Think there isn't just one type of intelligence.

One definition of intelligence - an ability to achieve complex goals or problems.

But issue is different types of problems - some more clearly defined, others less so, more 'wicked'

If we're trying to help physician and patient decide best treatment for a type of cancer, what if no research exists? If tried best practices and doesn't work? Physician and patient can also disagree on what 'best' is - this is an example of a wicked problem.

Don't like to talk about 'artificial intelligence' because it's not about replicating and replacing human intelligence, but how to complement address limitations of humans - i.e. no way I could crunch through all the data, or read all the research papers. waht if computer could help by just telling me what's new?

### Where are we with regards to the promise of AI?

Dawn: Need to be aware of whether AI or AI-driven systems are designed inclusively, with people who are affected able to provide feedback and be counted.

Mark: Often need people to provide the ground truth. 
On some systems that are more important, need decision support system: transparent and explainable.

Are we building appropriate trust - neither too little or too much so they imbue it with magical qualities

Melissa: Autonomous systems are relational systems.
What's changed is the structures and systems of our work, and how we are equipped today to do the work to craete such systems

With the distributed nature of the internet it's possible to annotate and create more input than before. 

Christian: Two jobs - one is extension of man. but isn't there a job for AI itself to make sure it doesn't tank again by overpromising massively.

Dawn: Work practices. One area I do have some hope is, having some data in hand that we can all look at could help. Won't shake strong ideology but could be a better approach.

Melissa: What does it mean to do more ethnographic type of work when it's so foundational - 8 years lead time between research and product on the road.

newer/newish useful work: Can we put in place measurement and evaluations systems that can play a role in affecting the output.

Christian: There's a place to be critical of the ideology, for example with agile.

Dawn: one reason why temperature controls get made into many products is because it's relatively easy data to work with (and therefore we're going to scope our problem accordingly). But instead should ask whether this is a problem we should be working on at all.

Lots of unexpected allies: data scientists, for example. There is a course at UC Davis on Data Archaeology taught by both an anthropologist and data scientist - why is that column there?
