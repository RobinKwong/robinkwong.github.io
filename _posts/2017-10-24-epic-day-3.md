## Shifting the Discipline - papers session

Themes:
Consider ways of changing and shifting ethnographic practice.  differen approdaches to conceptualising ethnographic research. new conceptual tools. disrup simple definitions of ethnography and its relation to adjacent disciplnes, i.e. tools of design to allow new objects to emerge, 

### Situated: Reconsidering Context in the Creation and Interpretation of Design Fictions
_Marta Cuciurean-Zapan • IDEO_

why 'design fiction': The future and the past offer the next largest context to the present
Ethnography immerses us in the field. Design fiction can take the thick description of ethnographers and pivot it to a 'what if'

Design fiction is characterised by an internally consistent story. i.e. breakfast scene in 2001. highlights isolation of astronauts rather than focusing on the ipad-like object (which 'blends in' in the scene)

Design fiction creates scaffolding to interrogate expectations and reactions to the future

4 approaches

1. participant and site selection. finding real world things that can be analogies for the design fiction you want to create. we can't go to the future so we go to a place that might be more like it one day.

get participants to interact with the design fiction.

2. narrative creation. use ethnography as a source for creating design fiction. 

Concept Kitchen 2025 - ethnography exposed desire to avoid waste and interest in germ transferrance which informed the design of the concept kitchen

3. co-creating provocations. provide participants with prompts to spark and direct conversation around the creation of a design fiction

4. multiple directions. Design fictions encourage multiple viewpoints, and the openness of the form invites exploration and experimentation. Focus on contradiction and contrast in particular.

design fiction can introduce branching into the design process. rotating realities.

this can be a more useful research tool than is currently used. the fictional world it creates is self-contained but has connections with the present world we are interrogating.

### TRACES: Towards Multi-Dimensional Ethnography
_Julia Haines • Google_

Pushing discipline forward by considering dimensionality of our work. Increasingly important given tech pervasiveness and human augmentation by technology.

In 90s. Movement towards multi-sited ethnography (as opposed to single-site ethnography). This is something similar but with digitisation.

experiential spaces are not always physical spaces they are virtual and ephemeral.

explore the boundaries and seams, flows and assemblages and multiple identity in these spaces.

explore human agency and action while accounting for machine agency and action

this is a progression:

digital as subject (90s)

-> digital as site (ethnography and virtual worlds in 00s)

-> digital as data source (ethnomining and trace ethnography in 2010s)

-> digital dimensionality

Rooted in activity theory: subjects have needs, object orientated, heirarchy of needs, 

Tools, methods and approaches used:

use of logs is not new - new bit is extending its use and how to combine it with other tools+data and new analysis to generate new meaning.

future direction: this goes beyond screen world and we need to account for other modalities. these are not places like a website, and are increasingly guided by machine learning
