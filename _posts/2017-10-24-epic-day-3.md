## Shifting the Discipline - papers session

Themes:
Consider ways of changing and shifting ethnographic practice.  differen approdaches to conceptualising ethnographic research. new conceptual tools. disrup simple definitions of ethnography and its relation to adjacent disciplnes, i.e. tools of design to allow new objects to emerge, 

### Situated: Reconsidering Context in the Creation and Interpretation of Design Fictions
_Marta Cuciurean-Zapan • IDEO_

why 'design fiction': The future and the past offer the next largest context to the present
Ethnography immerses us in the field. Design fiction can take the thick description of ethnographers and pivot it to a 'what if'

Design fiction is characterised by an internally consistent story. i.e. breakfast scene in 2001. highlights isolation of astronauts rather than focusing on the ipad-like object (which 'blends in' in the scene)

Design fiction creates scaffolding to interrogate expectations and reactions to the future

4 approaches

1. participant and site selection. finding real world things that can be analogies for the design fiction you want to create. we can't go to the future so we go to a place that might be more like it one day. Get participants to interact with the design fiction.

2. narrative creation. use ethnography as a source for creating design fiction. For example, Concept Kitchen 2025 - ethnography exposed desire to avoid waste and interest in germ transferrance which informed the design of the concept kitchen

3. co-creating provocations. provide participants with prompts to spark and direct conversation around the creation of a design fiction

4. multiple directions. Design fictions encourage multiple viewpoints, and the openness of the form invites exploration and experimentation. Focus on contradiction and contrast in particular.

design fiction can introduce branching into the design process. rotating realities.

this can be a more useful research tool than is currently used. the fictional world it creates is self-contained but has connections with the present world we are interrogating.

### TRACES: Towards Multi-Dimensional Ethnography
_Julia Haines • Google_

Pushing discipline forward by considering dimensionality of our work. Increasingly important given tech pervasiveness and human augmentation by technology.

In 90s. Movement towards multi-sited ethnography (as opposed to single-site ethnography). This is something similar but with digitisation.

experiential spaces are not always physical spaces they are virtual and ephemeral.

explore the boundaries and seams, flows and assemblages and multiple identity in these spaces.

explore human agency and action while accounting for machine agency and action

this is a progression:

digital as subject (90s)

-> digital as site (ethnography and virtual worlds in 00s)

-> digital as data source (ethnomining and trace ethnography in 2010s)

-> digital dimensionality

Rooted in activity theory: subjects have needs, object orientated, heirarchy of needs, 

Tools, methods and approaches used:

use of logs is not new - new bit is extending its use and how to combine it with other tools+data and new analysis to generate new meaning.

future direction: this goes beyond screen world and we need to account for other modalities. these are not places like a website, and are increasingly guided by machine learning

### Five Steps Behind: The Role for Ethnography in Bringing People Back to the First Steps of the Value Chain
_Martin Millard & Yosha Gargeya • ReD Associates_

global consumer goods companies faces a lot of challenges, in particular quality of product. They're struggling to make meaningful innovation.

Paper is about scientists at speciality chemical companies that develop products that help FMCGs develop products that taste, smell, feel etc the way it does

they deal with Qs like: If you stack 20 loaves of wonderbread on top of each other, how to ensure bottom loaf isn't squashed?
 
But if they are to have a bigger impact they need to shift perspective of consumer. They enable much of the product innovation in consumer goods today but are placed far, far away from the end consumer. 

Innovation is driven from a technical perspective.

THis causes a view of products that is dirven by what is objectively true.

industrial gas producer - what is best frozen food? A: need to freeze as soon as harvested. but to consumer, it's buying fresh ingredient cook, and freeze leftovers. 

industrial baker - test is: can i fold the bread and unfold it and it keeps same shape? never stopped to consider context in which this is even relevant.

they are extremely smart but don't think that understanding the customer is part of their job description: their customers (FMCGs) do so much consumer research that there's no way (and no point) for the supplier to understand the customer

they are reduced to taking instructions from their customers on what to innovate on. Problem: pipeline of problems that don't match their assets. Tunnel vision. Incremental improvements. Imprisoned opportunites (potential breakthrough innovations are locked early to the customer who provided the idea)

If they could shift perspectives:

Key learnings:
- learn the technology. those details need to be recorded
- Understand all the players in the supply chain

### Ethnographic Tools: From Insight to Intervention
_Wafa Said Mosleh • Southern Denmark University_

Worked with a company that was trying to become more structured in how they do front-end innovation. Introduced a structured form that employees had to fill in before projects became greenlighted.

Her project: figuring out what this shift (from a more informal to a more formal processs for front-end innovation) mean for employees? 

The tangible brief went from supporting managerial agenda to being a provocation of new conversation. The tool was negotiated through employee's use of it.

Tool has 4 levels. One level - talking about who are the stakeholders and when is it important to involve them. have a discussion about it rather than impose from above and assume everyone gets it

2nd level is resources.

3rd level is strategy. physical spider diagram to visualise how their project support different overall goals of the company.

4th level is physically mapping out the process of how it would happe

Thought that this project would 

All of a sudden, they have created 50 of these briefs and sent to manager, but nothing happened. So they spoke to manager, which forced the manager to admit that there was no actual resources to execute the projects, but was instead a way of reframing cost-cutting.

In follow-up sessions: found that employees hacked the system. so they physically moved to sit with internal customers to generate curiosity and enrol them as allies to fight for and acquire resources.  

These tangible artifacts could potentially challenge structures and challenge existing ways of doing things in companies.

Instead of just communicating my findings, could maybe do something with it in the field, and contribute with more than just insights.

### Mixed Method Approach for Identifying Emerging Fields and Building Collaborative Teams: Leveraging Network Ethnography to Design Experimental Interventions
_Therese Kennelly Okraku, Valerio Leone Sciabolazza, Raffaele Vacca & Christopher McCarty • University of Florida_

Started with question: How do scientists collaboarte? and how does that change over time? How to identify emerging research fields? 

Network ethnography- combines network analysis (structure shows what is happening) with ethnography (context shows why it is happening)

Ten steps of research process
1. participant observationa dn initial inverviews with scientists

2. use publication adn grant data to construct the network

3. choose community detection method (Louvain) and set criteria for identifying emerging research communities.  use ethnography to inform this decision.

4. Analyse web profiles

5. Interview and share community visualisation with scientists (feedback is that these are stable, small communities)

6. Revise criteria based on user's suggestiosn and get their feedback

7. interview and share revised community visualisation with scientists. Showing viz of different ways of defining community 

8. Share findings with org leaders to get buy in for network intervention. initially very sceptical of us trying to change nature of collaboration

9. identify pairs of scientists for collaboration

10. Invite paris to participate in our network intervention

Found different types of communities: i.e. Core Community, Bridging communities (i.e. epidemiology, emerging pathogens - lots going on, not everyone knows everyone)

Learnt ethnography helps us make chocies about what algorithms to use. Ppl sometimes think algorithms are objective criteria but 

users really enjoy interacting with network visualisation - being able to see it makes a difference both with participants, and with stakeholders. especially if you can also share the why with ethnography.

### Consumer Finance in a Mobile Age: Methods for Researching Changing User Behaviour
_Erin Taylor • Canela Consulting_

Overall trend in banking is one of greater choice. phone acts as a proxy - mediates movement so we don't have to move ourselves.
Other trend is unbundling

result of these trends is a type of thinking that says to just focus on a niche and ignore other things (like regulation, business customers, etc)

How do we help companies deal with this very puzzling change? basis of the changes is mobility of different kinds:

- Technological mobility

- Information mobility

- Product mobility

- Human mobility

What are the implications for research? Have to think about multiple channels, services, providers locations.

Created a toolkit of methods: financial diaries, object-centered interviews, social network analysis, etc.

People tend to keep all the information (their ledger) inside their heads.
