The way we report, present and distribute the news is changing rapidly, and running experiments is becoming more important for newsrooms trying to keep up with technological change.

A large part of my job as special projects editor at the FT is to think about doing experiments well. Central to this process is making sure your experiment has a distinct purpose, which can be a somewhat nebulous task.

There are several concrete ways to hone the focus of your experiment. I wrote about some of those ways in [this piece published on Poynter](http://www.poynter.org/2016/how-the-financial-times-is-getting-more-out-of-its-newsroom-experiments/410066/).

I will also be [facilitating a session](http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/#proposal-317223) on this topic at SRCCON in July.
