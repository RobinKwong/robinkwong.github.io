From Brian Collins's [interview with Debbie Millman](https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/design-matters-with-debbie-millman-brian-collins) on *Design Matters*:

> We tend to latch on to these simple bromides and clichÃ©s that fix our imagination. 
>
>"We're problem solvers!" Really? My problem solver is like, the plumber, or my roof needs to be fixed. I think what it does, to use a term by Ralph Caplan, is it turns us into 'exotic menials', which means we only get a call when there's a problem.
>
> There are so many things that are going to be problems and need to be anticipated. If you're going to be future facing, you can't wait for a problem because by the time the problem shows up, it's too late.
>
>So problem seeking means you've got to go out and be on your front foot, and look, and be self-propelled. Look for answering problems and answering questions that people don't know how to ask.
>
> Problem solving is not only inaccurate, but damaging. Seeking, is what we should be doing.
