> Many commentators worry that we’re segregating ourselves in ideological bubbles, exposed only to the views of those who think the same way we do. There’s something in that concern. But for 96 per cent of these web surfers the bubble that mattered wasn’t liberal or conservative, it was: **“Don’t bother with the news.”**

> A: The bigger problem is they don’t subscribe to a journal they do agree with. I don’t think they read anything, and I don’t mean my students in particular, I mean people in general. I’ve had people ask, “Well, what can I do to be better informed?” I say, “I start every morning reading The Washington Post.” They say, “Well, that’s biased and liberal, and I’m not going to read it.” I say, “All right, read The Wall Street Journal.” “Well, that’s just…I’m not reading it.” In other words, I’m not going to read anything. What they really want to know is how do I wake up every morning and glance at a screen and then call myself informed?

<span class="firstLetter">P</span>roduct developers like to use 'personas' &mdash; archetypes that embody a set of goals and behaviours &mdash; to better understand the customers they are designing for. In digital news companies, designers might differentiate between the following personas:

💁: "I need to stay on top of what's happening in the world"

👨🏾: "I need to research a particular issue for work"

👼: "I need to know what's trending"

But while these statements may represent different customer segments, they also share the common feature of expressing a curiosity about the world. 💁, 👨🏾 and 👼 all belong in the 4 per cent of people who 'bother with the news'. 

The entire business and practice of journalism is built on the foundational assumption that people come to us with a need to be informed. Thompson Reuters brands itself as ['The Answer Company'](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/the-answer-company.html). The Economist is for ["the globally curious"](https://medium.com/severe-contest/from-man-in-a-suit-to-the-globally-curious-4ed44704550a#.5iyksfvfh). The New York Times has staked its future on being ["an authoritative, clarifying and vital destination"](https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/) for its readers.

There's nothing wrong with catering to a target market; it makes good business sense to do so. And 4 per cent of the online world is more than enough potential paying customers to sustain a good number of profitable newsrooms.

But few, if any, of us became journalists to write for 4 per cent of the world. To the extent that journalism has a civic as well as a commercial imperative, being irrelevant to 96 per cent of the population ought to be seen as an urgent crisis.

So even though there is still [so](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/public-editor/a-community-of-one-the-times-gets-tailored.html) [much](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/authoritative-readable-branded-report-from-poynter-design-challenge-part-2-42cef2bd0b67#.7en4fc5qw) [more](http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/04/04/a-faster-ft-com/) [we](https://mondaynote.com/quality-for-news-is-mostly-about-solving-the-reputation-issue-fdebd0dcc9e2#.o1g6og2dk) [can](https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d#.uhu6cyvkv) [do](http://scripting.com/2016/12/10/perspectiveIsEverything.html) to better serve people who need and seek out the news, we must also try a different approach. One that asks: 

"How do we <i>create</i> a need for news?"

---

> The path forward is hazy. We need to enable people to hear different perspectives and make sense of a very complicated — and in many ways, overwhelming — information landscape. We cannot fall back on standard educational approaches because the societal context has shifted. We also cannot simply assume that information intermediaries can fix the problem for us, whether they be traditional news media or social media.
>
>We need to get creative and build the social infrastructure necessary for people to meaningfully and substantively engage across existing structural lines. This won’t be easy or quick, but if we want to address issues like propaganda, hate speech, fake news, and biased content, we need to focus on the underlying issues at play. No simple band-aid will work.

<span class="firstLetter">N</span>o simple band-aid will work, but as information intermediaries, news media can start by focusing on how we can equip people to ask the right questions, rather than just feeding them what we think are the right answers. 

Instead of trying to make it effortless for people to understand a complex and chaotic world, we can strive to make it inviting for them to explore that world, and reflect upon it.

This is not the general direction that our community of digital journalists, data visualisation experts in newsrooms, and journo-coders is heading in. Instead, a consensus is forming around the belief that simplicity, relevance, and directed storytelling works (and by implication: complexity, serendipity and exploration don't work in news).

The New York Times's Archie Tse encapsulated this thinking in his *Rules for Visual Storytelling (2016 edition)*:

The roots of this thinking goes back at least a decade, to Bret Victor's canonical [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) paper. There, he suggests that information software design should be approached primarily as graphic design and consequently, that interaction should be minimised, if not entirely eliminated.

> The foremost concern should be appearance &mdash; what and how information is presented. The designer should ask: What is relevant information? What questions will the viewer ask? What situations will she want to compare? What decision is she trying to make? How can the data be presented most effectively? How can the visual vocabulary and techniques of graphic design be employed to direct the user’s eyes to the solution? The designer must start by considering what the software looks like, because the user is using it to learn, and she learns by looking at it.

These are good design principles that [we follow at the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c62b21c6-7feb-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4). But problems arise when everyone takes the easy way out &mdash; choosing only to ask readers to scroll, for example, instead of trying to make something "specatcular" happen. Or, when we design only for 💁, 👨🏾 or 👼 because we pretend to know what their needs are, and because we know that they will bother with the news. 

Too often, we fail to imagine that 'the viewer' could be motivated by anything other than self-interest:

> If we’re really _really_ honest about ourselves, what’s the one thing that’s endlessly fascinating to us and we could talk about forever?
>
>Right. Ourselves.

Narcissism is a powerful motivator, but it isn't the only one. And when it becomes the main driver behind the design of our entire media landscape, from [data-driven stories](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-15391515) to [social media](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/), it creates undesired side effects. News stories, after all, don't just teach their readers about how the world is changing. In aggregate, the media environment they create also conditions how people interact with the world and what they expect of it.

> People have become overly critical of journalists for the same reason that they’re overly critical of government. They’re critical of journalists for giving them exactly what they want &mdash; stories tailored to them, pared down, pre-chewed and dressed up with pretty pictures &mdash; and then they say the media isn’t informing us enough.

If we design news stories solely for narcissists, how can we be surprised to discover a world lacking in empathy and curiosity? 

---

> People put themselves at a distance from whatever stories we hear, unless extraordinary measures are taken by the storyteller. Our inabilities to conjure the emotional and physical enormities within a news story are ingrained as a defense mechanism, and it’s one we sorely need: it would be difficult to function if we could picture every sick child in an article about disease, or every dead body in a report about war.
>
> Our brains sanitize the input they receive to shield us from this emotional transference. This distance can be injurious in less obvious ways: the more ways in which someone’s life differs from ours, the harder it can be to fully relate when we are faced with that person’s reality. We often hear and mentally acknowledge a person’s story without ever quite fully understanding their circumstances.

<span class="firstLetter">H</span>ow do we make stories that can permeate that protective barrier and prompt people to drop their emotional shields?

The quest for immersive storytelling, for 'really good prose that sucks you in', all constitute "extraordinary measures taken by the storyteller" to bridge that gap.

But there is another way. Bret Victor referred to it in a footnote deep within Magic Ink:

> It must be mentioned that there is a radically alternative approach for information software &mdash; games. Playing is essentially learning through structured manipulation &mdash; exploration and practice instead of pedagogic presentation. 

<div class="quote-attrib"><a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/" target="_blank"><i>Magic Ink</i></a><br>Bret Victor</div>

Games have long been recognised as [important learning tools](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972), but, as Mr Victor also noted: "Despite the enormous potential for mainstream software, accidents of history and fashion have relegated games to the entertainment bin, and the stigma of immaturity is tough to overcome."

Cost was also a factor. Even if news organisation were inclined to overcome the "stigma of immaturity", the lack of skills and technology in newsrooms meant that games were an expensive, difficult and inefficient alternative to the traditional article. 

Some of those constraints are starting to ease. Games sit squarely within mainstream culture, and newsrooms have hired developers and digital designers. 

Some of the language of games have already entered mainstream software design through 'gamification'. But to focus only on the techniques that create a steady dopamine drip to keep players hooked, is to lose sight of the much greater potential of games.

Games are important because they create space for empathy. They give permission to their players to reconnect with their sense of curiosity. Together, these two things invite exploration and, if directed towards jouranlism, could entice people to *want* to learn about the world: 

> Ultimately, if anything, a game is a dialogue &mdash; players speak to you in the breaths and pauses between the constraints you’ve created. This collaboration is precisely how something incredibly personal can become resonant and universal; the only way to truly reach out to others is through yourself.
>
>Games are the ultimate expression of immersive empathy, because systems are the purest way to transfer feelings and mindsets between one person and another.

<div class="quote-attrib"><a href="https://elizabethsampat.itch.io/empathy-engines" target="_blank"><i>Empathy Engines</i></a><br> Elizabeth Sampat</div>

> Games changes how we see topics, it changes our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves. We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so.

<span class="firstLetter">I</span> am lucky enough to have a chance to explore this topic on the inaugural FT-Nikkei fellowship programme. I will be in San Francisco until May 30 for the fellowship, and will be chronicling what I learn on this blog. To summarise, these are the questions I will be exploring:

- What does it mean for games to be journalism? Is interactive non-fiction an oxymoron?

- How can we create a need for news by igniting curiosity? How can we make the FT a place that sparks new enquiry, instead of one that just answers our readers questions?

- How can journalism encourage exploration, particularly through the use of digital technologies including interactivity and Virtual Reality?

- How do we tell stories that create emotional understanding and empathy?
