Before I became the Financial Timesâ€™ Special Projects Editor, I spent 18 months on the interactive desk. I arrived there with, basically, absolutely zero knowledge of even the basic skills.

Proud to say that I now know a tiny smidgen about:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* D3
* QGIS
* R
* Audio editing
* Data journalism & visualisation
* Typography
* Human-centered design
* Social media analytics
* GIF/Meme-fu
