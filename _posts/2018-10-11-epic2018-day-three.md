## Whatâ€™s Fair in a Data-Mediated World?

Elizabeth Churchill, Astrid Countee, Nathan Good, Miriam Lueck Avery

_This panel will discuss questions of fairness and justice in data-centric systems. While the many social problems caused by data-centric systems are well known, what options are available to us to make things better? Chair Elizabeth Churchill will draw the panelists and audience into conversation about making change on many levels, in our daily work as well as larger-scale collaborations._

What's fair?

- in accordance with rules or statndards; legitimate
- without cheating
- without trying to achieve (or achieving) unjust advantage

Intended and unintended data baises:

- Activity bias
- Data bias
- Sampling bias
- Algorithmic bias
- Interaction bias
- Self-selection bias
- Second order bias
- Interpretation bias

What is evidence and what do we treat as evidence?
