# Jennifer Shahade

Jennifer Shahade is an author, chess champion, commentator and poker player. Her books, Play Like a Girl and Chess Bitch, aim to attract more women to chess. She is the Mind Sports Ambassador for PokerStars and a board member at the World Chess Hall of Fame. She has explored the artistic aspects in chess and poker in projects such as hula chess, Roulette Chess, and in co-writing Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess. She graduated with a degree in comparative literature from NYU in 2003.

- A lot of people think talent is something you have or not (but that's not true)
- Originally, the Queen in chess was not 'the queen' but vizier and a weak piece until about 1500
- Came from a family of strong chess players. When growing up, was teased: What, you're a Shahade and you only have 1200/1400 [ELO]? Which, she notes, was not bad for a 10 yr old!
- Chess & Art: Yoko Ono designed a chess set called 'Play it with trust'. It had all white pieces. The idea was that eventually, ppl would forget whose pieces is whose, and will call a truce. But Jennifer played with that set with grandmasters and no one forgot and there was no truce. "When you get a bunch of gamers together, they will want to find a winner" 
- People are often v impressed by chess simulatenous b/c they think the player remembers the board or is simultaneously playing lots of games in their heads. But that's not the case. 90% of the time, you're just moving from A to B and making the first move you see (but when you've studied chess, your first move is often enough to beat people who haven't studied it)
- However, what is hard is blindfolded chess. (shows Magnus Carlson doing a blindfold exhibition). To do that you do have to memorise the board and play it entirely in your mind. It requires memory tricks. For example, one of best blindfold players said: had phonographic memory rather than photographic memory so used opponent's voice to remember the moves.
- Anatolya Karpov: Said he doesn't like blindfold chess cos it hurt his head
- Jennifer: Blindfold chess feels difficult just for difficulty's sake. This applies to a lot of memory games
- Chess: meta game now has too many draws. It's anticlimatic for newcomers
- Recommended house rules for poker: more forced bets; everyone should look at cards immediately upon being dealt.

## On the parallels between chess and poker 

- very few female professionals, especially in high buy-in games. "Maybe women are just better at managing their money!"
- Women who tend to be more successful in poker and chess tend to play with a more aggressive style. Jennifer's theory is that it's mostly incidental rather than due to some causation. Women tend to get a lot more attention in both those games, and aggressive styles are more celebrated
- On playing style in math-driven games: Poker almost all math-based. But sometimes there are two moves with same 'equity', and that's where style comes in. Players who are too mathematical tend to be only ok. and only being ok in poker is not enough to make a living because there's a rake.
- "You'll be amazed at what poker players think is a reasonable contract"
- Good poker play is a lot like finding arbitrage opportunities - there's what the mathematic models say is the correct move. i.e. if you raise, then your opponent should defend his hand 50% of the time. But if you observe that this population of players (in this tournament, for example) defend only 25% of the time, then you make an adjustment and form a heuristic to take advantage: raise a lot more often.
- But this is different in Chess. In chess generally best to just play the optimal move. Because if your opponent is going to be fooled by a suboptimal move, then s/he can be beaten by you playing optimally.
- Sad part about chess: much of the magic of chess is lost to players who are not experts. for example, magical to achieve flow state in a long classical chess game: v visual experience. magic happens when you see an amazing move in your head. But most of the time that move  doesn't show up on the board)
- That's why commentary is so important for chess.
- Poker is more attrative to viewers than chess because of the money, and also becuase with 'hole cam' viewers can play along 
- Money stakes inherent to poker but more as a way of keeping score for competitive/expert players. those who actually worry about the money don't play well

## On learning
- It is more important to do lots of chess problems rather than one really hard one. Because you need to do the easy stuff over and over again in practice, so you can see the solution even when you are in throes of competition and stressed out
- AI in chess: bad is that ppl can't play online for money because of cheaters. Good thing is that everyone can play against AI and study 24/7, so there are now really great players coming out of disadvantaged areas or places that aren't traditional chess hotspots.
- Studying the right things is important. Some things are so fascinating because they're crazy situations but they are so rare it's not worth studying them. much better to study the situations that come up all the time 
- Sometimes you get lost in problems that excite you personally. That's where discipline in learning comes in
