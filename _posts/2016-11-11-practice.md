# Jennifer Shahade

Jennifer Shahade is an author, chess champion, commentator and poker player. Her books, Play Like a Girl and Chess Bitch, aim to attract more women to chess. She is the Mind Sports Ambassador for PokerStars and a board member at the World Chess Hall of Fame. She has explored the artistic aspects in chess and poker in projects such as hula chess, Roulette Chess, and in co-writing Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess. She graduated with a degree in comparative literature from NYU in 2003.

- A lot of people think talent is something you have or not (but that's not true)
- Originally, the Queen in chess was not 'the queen' but vizier and a weak piece until about 1500
- Came from a family of strong chess players. When growing up, was teased: What, you're a Shahade and you only have 1200/1400 [ELO]? Which, she notes, was not bad for a 10 yr old!
- Chess & Art: Yoko Ono designed a chess set called 'Play it with trust'. It had all white pieces. The idea was that eventually, ppl would forget whose pieces is whose, and will call a truce. But Jennifer played with that set with grandmasters and no one forgot and there was no truce. "When you get a bunch of gamers together, they will want to find a winner" 
- People are often v impressed by chess simulatenous b/c they think the player remembers the board or is simultaneously playing lots of games in their heads. But that's not the case. 90% of the time, you're just moving from A to B and making the first move you see (but when you've studied chess, your first move is often enough to beat people who haven't studied it)
- However, what is hard is blindfolded chess. (shows Magnus Carlson doing a blindfold exhibition). To do that you do have to memorise the board and play it entirely in your mind. It requires memory tricks. For example, one of best blindfold players said: had phonographic memory rather than photographic memory so used opponent's voice to remember the moves.
- Anatolya Karpov: Said he doesn't like blindfold chess cos it hurt his head
- Jennifer: Blindfold chess feels difficult just for difficulty's sake. This applies to a lot of memory games
- Chess: meta game now has too many draws. It's anticlimatic for newcomers
- Recommended house rules for poker: more forced bets; everyone should look at cards immediately upon being dealt.

## On the parallels between chess and poker 

- very few female professionals, especially in high buy-in games. "Maybe women are just better at managing their money!"
- Women who tend to be more successful in poker and chess tend to play with a more aggressive style. Jennifer's theory is that it's mostly incidental rather than due to some causation. Women tend to get a lot more attention in both those games, and aggressive styles are more celebrated
- On playing style in math-driven games: Poker almost all math-based. But sometimes there are two moves with same 'equity', and that's where style comes in. Players who are too mathematical tend to be only ok. and only being ok in poker is not enough to make a living because there's a rake.
- "You'll be amazed at what poker players think is a reasonable contract"
- Good poker play is a lot like finding arbitrage opportunities - there's what the mathematic models say is the correct move. i.e. if you raise, then your opponent should defend his hand 50% of the time. But if you observe that this population of players (in this tournament, for example) defend only 25% of the time, then you make an adjustment and form a heuristic to take advantage: raise a lot more often.
- But this is different in Chess. In chess generally best to just play the optimal move. Because if your opponent is going to be fooled by a suboptimal move, then s/he can be beaten by you playing optimally.
- Sad part about chess: much of the magic of chess is lost to players who are not experts. for example, magical to achieve flow state in a long classical chess game: v visual experience. magic happens when you see an amazing move in your head. But most of the time that move  doesn't show up on the board)
- That's why commentary is so important for chess.
- Poker is more attrative to viewers than chess because of the money, and also becuase with 'hole cam' viewers can play along 
- Money stakes inherent to poker but more as a way of keeping score for competitive/expert players. those who actually worry about the money don't play well

## On learning
- It is more important to do lots of chess problems rather than one really hard one. Because you need to do the easy stuff over and over again in practice, so you can see the solution even when you are in throes of competition and stressed out
- AI in chess: bad is that ppl can't play online for money because of cheaters. Good thing is that everyone can play against AI and study 24/7, so there are now really great players coming out of disadvantaged areas or places that aren't traditional chess hotspots.
- Studying the right things is important. Some things are so fascinating because they're crazy situations but they are so rare it's not worth studying them. much better to study the situations that come up all the time 
- Sometimes you get lost in problems that excite you personally. That's where discipline in learning comes in  

# Aleissia Laidacker

Aleissia is a game programmer-designer-producer who has been working as a developer for 16 years and developing games at Ubisoft for 10 of them. She was Lead AI on multiple Assassin’s Creed games. Her passion for design has pushed her teams to think about why we are developing our games rather than just how we develop them. She empowers her teams to think outside of the box through game jams and experimentation. As part of the Diversity Committee at Ubisoft, she mentors kids and gives talks at schools to inspire young girls to pursue careers in tech and games.

## Systems are Everywhere... Right Elon Musk?

- Often the obivious and simple things end up being very complicated, especially in games
- She went through a lot of failures to make games that are truly systemic becasue she made them too complicated. Along the way, learnt when to stop, ask questions and then to iterate. There is a method and a process you can use to create systemic games. this talk explains that 
- Game systems: a set of elements with own inputs and outputs, and elements that should influence each other. For a game to be 'systemic', it means that there's a link between all your systems, and they affect each other

- Why should we care about creating systemic games?
1. Many oppportunities: the more the player acts upon the systems, the more the game adapts
2. Emergence gameplay: allows for unpredictability. As a developer, she loves when players discover ways of interacting with the system
3. Quick iterations: forces use of modular framework in developing the game, and therefore allows flexibility
4. Replayability: Different story/experience for the player every time. It doesn't take a monster team to develop systems, and usually invovles creating a lot less content (for same amount of replayability)

- An example magic of systemic games: [You are a kitten in a catnip forest](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/). She started playing this and left the browser tab open, and left for a week. "When I came back, unicorns were created in my absence and the cats were sacrificing the unicorns for their tears to satisfy their god in the game"

## The Framework
- Systems: made up of game objects and their connections. Goal is to create as many connections as possible between the objects
- Objects: has visual, sound, physics and gameplay components. Has inputs and outputs. But (in her approach) all of this is controlled through the system's main logic, optional logic, and feedback

- Think of main logic as the objects in your system. Make the main logic as 'light' as possible
- Think of optional logic as classes, with attributes. It's where you put the bulk of your code and logic. So for example:

- nourishment class has attribute is-a-resource-type. You might have all sorts of main logic items (cake, steak, salad) that belong to this class.

- Make sure your classes are as generic as possible but have as many attributes as possible. Once you set up your main and optional logic, the inputs and outputs will flow from that. 
- Very important to build in feedback from the start.

- Once you have your basic main and optional logic set up, you need a way to have an overview of your system

## Visualising your system

- She uses visjs.org for visualising node networking
- The goal of the graph is to find islands that aren't connected to anything. Also, to enable a conversation: Is this game object useful?
- So for example, leaf nodes: are they weak in gameplay terms by definition? Not necessarily, b/c could be story-meaningful, and be an input into an object that affects lots of others
- Graph is also useful when adding new objects: figuring out what effects it would have

Example: adding a new plant object

- think first what inputs and outputs plants should have
- create new main logic object plant
- find what existing optional logic classes already exist
- find what existing feedback you already have

In going through this process, find that she doesn't have anything in her world that has water as output. So, does she create that part of the simulation?

Think through: water - what input and output should it have?
Sample water outputs: impacts organic life, fire, temperature, etc
See if those things are already in the world, and whether adding water would create interesting gameplay. Also, does the plant object need water?
But the thing is: the more you add, the more you are going to have to think about feedback. The player always has to understand what's happening in the game

The point is that this gives you a framework for decision making.

## You've built a sandbox. Now what?

So now that you have a network of game objects, defined main and optional logics and have feedback. But... what you have is a sandbox. A play space where things fit together. but it's not a game yet

In this sandbox, your player can feel smart (by figuring out the systems), but it doesn't necessarily mean your game is fun

How to make it fun?
Ask, how does the player play? What tools have I given the player?

game mechanics: what tools? what interactions (verbs)?

useful tool for figuring out what you have and have not given players: build cross-matricies that map out what the intended interaction would be between:
- system vs system
- system vs ingredient
- npc vs npc
- (i.e. do all of them)

The goal of doing this is to see what verbs exist. Are any too specific? too common? too overpowered/underpower?
for example, so many actions are coded under 'kill' this hides interesting gameplay because it reduces everything to that one interaction. What to do: create more tools to create more/different verbs

Matrices help you identify blank holes. For example, game has no tools to manipulate atmosphere. 
This raises question of whether for objects with a lot of blanks, should they be cut? 

How to answer that question? Develop player stories

Example: Make a tools/game objects cross matrix. but instead of filling in matrix with verb, write player stories:

Rope/bucket + fire. Player story: I can grab water with bucket and rope to put out fire but maybe also burn rope to spread fire?

Goal of doing this: 
- tools that seemed less useful might actually have use when mixed with other actions
- player stories might identify other tools/systems/ingredients

Tips for finding the fun:
- iteration is key
- the more player stories you develop, the more you refine your systems/tools/verbs

## You have a game?
At this point, player feel smart, are having fun, but still something missing: World Impact.

You haven't yet considered:
- Can a system overtake the world?
- Can a system become extinct?
- Does this impact narrative?
- What's the ultimate goal/possible ending?

(But, if you want to put a bunch of constraints on your system, why make it systemic in the first place?)

How to think through these problems: again, build cross-matricies. This time, of game objects/impact (lack of, too many, player fantasy)

Goal of this exercise: identify break points, questions to ask, how to refine the system
Overall goal: By catering to player fantasies you give them a sense of agency.

## Back to the first question

Why make a systemic game in the first place?

Quote from Westworld: "It's not about giving the gamer what YOU think they want." 

"They are not looking for a story that tells them who they are, they already know who they are.they are here because they want a glimpse of why they could become"

1. players want to feel they've experienced something that othrers may not have found
2. opportunities for creating are for a diverse audience
3. stop devleoping games for one type of player/person

One day AI will make games that adapt to any player and the way they play it, but until then we can use smart systemic design to give space for exploration and to achieve those goals.

### Noticing by Design - how games change how we see the world
Not the talk I want to give. Do that one in your head in 5 secs

### Noticing-design - a practical guide to manipulating player attention
Not the talk I want to give either. Do that in your head in 10 secs

### Designing noticing - Games of paying attention and noticing thing
"First Person Noticers" term from Kate Compton
(not the talk I want to give either)

"Noticing is a game mechanic, not an incidental part of human experience"

### Designing, Noticing
The actual talk: how designing game affects us

You can't design a VR game right now because the technology is so visible and new. In the first 5 secs, all people see is the headset and the technology.

Imagine the game world bubble here and real world bubble there. There's a weak arrow of noticing from gameworld -> realworld
Some games emphasise that. i.e. The Witness.

But this needs to be designed/reinforced. You can present the gameworld and convey understanding of a theoretical model, but if you don't reinforce the noticing in the real world, then it doesn't happen. 

"How do you see something that's not even in the model of your world?"

## Completing the circle

To complete the feedback loop, how to bring real-world noticing back into the theory/model/game?

The key thing here is that you can't just take everything in the real world back into your model. You need to filter what you bring back into the model/game/theory

To have those filters you need to look beyond your model for wider context. Otherwise, "this is how conspiracies can get made": If you are great at self-consistant systems...

Aside: when she makes a doodling game on youtube and people are at home drawing along with her on their own notebooks, it's "real-time client-side rendering" 

A lot of the problem with education is that people are just taught the rules of the system without asking critical questions about context.
So when Vi makes a doodling game, she names the rules but she also tries to explain why those are the rules.

But also: No amount of perfect filtering will get you a model of the real world

How do you see something that's not even in the model of your world?
(Her answer: listen to and believe in personal stories, and take them into account when you construct your models of the world) In political discourse, it's all hypothetical and very little to do with personal stories

It doesn't matter how logical you are or how good you are at judgement if you don't even notice in the first place or can look without judgment in the first place.

Question: How do you have a game that makes you notice things in the real world and also have your real-world experiences be thigns you  can take back into the game and make it better? This is what we get as game designers/artists, But the player doesn't get that experience


She run through her VR mapping work: "More fun than a [hypercube of monkeys](http://monkeys.hypernom.com/)"
