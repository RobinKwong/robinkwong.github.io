I am attending [iDocs 2018](https://idocs2018.dcrc.org.uk/), a three day event dedicated to the expanding & evolving field of interactive documentary, in Bristol and will be taking notes on the sessions here.

## Keynote: [The Shoreline](http://theshorelineproject.org/) - Liz Miller

_Liz Miller presents and discusses collaborative interactive documentary project The Shoreline – a storybook for sustainable
futures. The shoreline is a site – where the land meets the sea, where excessive development meets the power of nature, and where climate change dramatically impacts lives and ecosystems. The shoreline is a story device; a site to connect human and non-human communities that survive and adapt in one of the most dynamic places on the planet. The shoreline is also a method – a way to challenge boundaries and narratives in addressing climate-disasters._

First interactive was in 1999 - Moles. Made with Flash 1 - could stream 7 secs of video

"If you want to get others to use this medium you need to come to grips with your own story.""

Other projects: Hands On, Going Public: The art of participatory practice.

Hands on: Poly-vocal solutions based approach.

She teaches in class and many students get overwhelmed because many solutions are either individual-based, or out of reach.

"As an educator I use interactives all the time, and they work.""

Interactivity allows educators to bring together bite-sized content and allow parallel use of it.

When gathering stories, hosted a wordpress site that has now become a forum of exchange for educators

3 ways to navigate the site: first is by chapters (there are six). Second is through a map. 3rd is through a database (topics/strategy toolkit)

Soundscapes are really effective for elementary classrooms.

Can go from stories to the Strategy Toolkit, or to the community where the story is based and use an interactive map to see what the land would be like if sea level rose by up to 6m

Each chapter ends of 'floodviews', dystopic visions of what the future would look like. 

Also created workshop cards for non-profits and educators - a way to get a 'playlist' of content from a trustworthy source.

Intention fo the project:

- Reach across disciplines and pedagogical levels

- free and accessible

- engage with data visualisation

In short: 'a video textbook for change'

One of the challenges of idocs for social change is that every profile is an opportunity. tension between too much information overwhelming and desire to capture these opportunities. Interactivity / curation is a solution to this tension.

### Q&A

The first iteration was a database. Current version has a lot more curation.

Users got used to the first iteration and was reluctant to change to subsequent versions.

One big lesson: less is more.

Q: Do you start with the money first, or the concept?
A: We're in year 4. I always start with prototypes and small projects. The New Zealand videos I shot 5 years ago. People's live chnage and left their jobs in the time I was working. 

2 years of [video] production and one year doing the interactivity. It was most expensive and difficult part. 

People want paths but they don't want to be constrained by paths.

Q: Would you think of your project as linear or non-linear?
A: The way that the story unfolded itself, it really never had a coherent linear film. it was a network film. If there was a film along the way that I wanted to make it would be a film about mangroves.

Early advice: 'you're cutting them like short films. you're not cutting them like internet films.

It's about entry: you have to start in the middle'
