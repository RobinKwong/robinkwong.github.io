A big focus of my [Nikkei-FT Fellowship](/fellowship/) is the question of how we can use interactivity in digital journalism to encourage exploration and curiosity.

To answer this question, I started looking at other places where this was being done well:

[The Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/) is a hands-on museum of science, art, and human perception in San Francisco founded by Frank Oppenheimer. It hosted more than 850,000 visitors in 2016, and has inspired other science museums worldwide.

How does the Exploratorium encourage exploration, and what can makers of interactive journalism learn from it? Here are seven lessons.

## Onboarding

The first exhibits that a visitor encounters have several characteristics that make them good 'tutorials' that prepare visitors for the rest of the museum. 

- They are, as the sign says, open-ended. There are no specific goals you have to reach, as a visitor.
- They are physical. You engage with these exhibits by turning a dial or a crank, or pressing a button, as opposed to passive observation.
- They are varied, and social. One of the opening exhibits can be explored alone, but another is collaborative, while a third is competitive (race a friend to get a butterfly-like object to the top)
- Finally, they...

## Establish a consistent design pattern

Every exhibit in the museum follows the same pattern:

- The physical appearance of the exhibit attracts you to it
- You read the title and subtitle of the exhibit
- You try to manipulate it, reading the instructions in cases where it wasn't immediately and intuitively obvious
- You observe the effect of your actions, and play with the exhibit
- You (maybe) read and learn about the science behind it

This is a design that prioritises exploration over pedagogy. The 'so what', which is given primacy in most news storytelling, is the *least* prioritised aspect of the exhibit. 

By establishing a design pattern and sticking to it, the Exploratorium helps lower the cognitive load of engaging with any subsequent exhibit That is generally not the case with most interactive news stories &mdash; just because you've once learnt how to use an interactive calculator published by the FT, for example, doesn't mean that it'll be easier for you to learn how to use the next one.

## A sense of safety

People are risk adverse. We don't like to be shown to be ignorant or wrong. If we want people to engage with new things, we have to provide them with a sense of safety.

Frank Oppenheimer emphasised that "no one ever failed a science museum". The exploratorium ensures that by creating a space where it is the social norm to explore, experiment, and even to fail. Initially hesitant visitors become less so when they see others playing with the exhibits. 

How do we create a similar set of social norms around interactive pieces of journalism, especially when they exist within a context (Facebook, news website, etc) that encourages a different mode of engagement?

## Setting the right expectations

It's called *The Exploratorium*. Those who show up are pre-disposed to exploring and engaging their curiosity. In many ways, more than half the battle has already been won by the time a person hands over $29.95 to enter the museum.

## Breaking expectations

And yet, much of what's in the exploratorium defies the preconception of what one would encounter in a museum. There are exhibits on wheels that you can encouraged to rotate. There are live mosquitos and decaying rats. The exploratorium encourages visitors to try new experiences by surprising first, and informing after.

## Richness and variety

It may seem an obvious point, but if you want people to explore and indulge their curiosity, then you have to give a rich enough world to explore. The Exploratorium has hundreds of exhibits and 50,000 pages on its website. By contrast, the recent trend in journalistic data visualisation has been for the author to pre-determine the story and guide readers through it, hiding away data that is irrelevant to the story.

## Prioritise user testing

One of the most central and prominent spaces within the Exploratorium is the Exhibit Development Shop, in front of which are placed new, and often half-finished, exhibits for visitors to play with. Staff working in the machine shop can observe how visitors interact with their works-in-progress, and make adjustments accordingly. In fact, this ethos of user testing and joint development is central to the origin story of the entire museum. It's not only the visitors who are learning by doing; the museum itself is, too.
