I'm back (virtually) at [EPIC](https://2021.epicpeople.org/) again this year! I'm going to try to reprise my live note taking from [EPIC 2018](https://robinkwong.com/epic2018_summary) though I probably won't be able to be as comprehensive as before.

Direct quotes are in quotation marks. Everything else is my notes/paraphrased.


## Keynote: The Future of Audiences and Mixed Reality Performances
_Sarah Ellis, Director of Digital Development for the Royal Shakespeare Company_

Going to talk about a project called [Dream](https://www.rsc.org.uk/news/dream-on-demand), which is part of the Audience of the Future programme.

Audience of the Future was all about investment in research and development, and collaboration.

Q was: How to have a relationship between practictioner and research to look at future tools


Dream was a live, online perfomance set in a virtual forest. Uses real-time mocap, VR, Gesturement (interactive music), Unreal Engine, to combine live and online.

Dream was never supposed to happen. came through the pandemic and a pivot that we had to do during the pandemic.

Project started when they were broadening perspective from a previous project with Intel in 2016. Had lots of different partners including Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF) and Philharmonia Orchestra. Partly research project but the main deliverable was a performance.

But when Pandemic hit, all they had was this music that was recorded the week before the pandemic hit.

How we anticipate the future and think about the future

This wasn't a Shakespeare play in the way that you ahd expected it or anticipated it, and that's why we all came together to explore (tools and audiences of the future)

Shakespeare plays "are great reference points for us to explore"

Every student in the UK learns Shakespeare and most of the world have some connection to it so we have a responsibliity to make Shakespeare relevant to people today. 

7mx7m performance volume represents 7kmx7km space in VR. audience and actor saw same backdrop.

Was not a linear performance of midsommer night's dream but that also reflects the fact that the

Puck was the character and you ahd to help them find their way through the forest - during the way you meet other characters from Midsummer night's dream. 

We needed to create a world that people believed in and emotionally engaged in.

How can we use these technology to see how to hold live performances and virtual spaces at the same time?

If you look at film, animation, etc, actors have adapted their craft for the performances required by those formats - same for gaming technology (i.e. mocap+VR) now.

We need to give actors (using the technology) the best chances and best ability to establish the emotional connection online. and ensure that the tech doesn't fail.

lockdown - no live performances, no physical gatherings. So we needed a pathway to reach audiences, online. 

Commissioned research (a survey) to ask audience where they were at. Came back with 3 compelling headlines for us:

1. Craving togetherness
2. Craving liveness
3. Huge digital inequity in people's homes.

We have abelist biases around what technology audiences have access to. 

This performance was not just performed at 8pm every night. We changed the performance time to cater to audiences around the world.

We couldn't justify making a performance for VR headsets in the home (there aren't enough VR headsets). We couldn't justify even mkaing a performance for the most up-to-date iPhones for example.

We built this experience for desktop, mobile, and tablet even if it was lower-spec

We shouldn't assume everyone has access to really high-spec wifi

These are the challenges we have now in hybrid working

"We are in a world of creators so they know how to make work and they know what it takes to make work. But if we look at [the popularity of] minecraft, etc they also know what these works are about."

When we're looking at emergent technologies, what we don't have is the rituals and culture that we have with physical performances. Anyone who has been to the theatre there are anticipations. You might not think about them up front or consciously but we do them together [to create the anticipation].

These rituals are starting to emerge (we wave goodbye on zoom meetings, etc)

We need to really, really re-address the issues of who's making this content, who this content is for,

need to think from a non-abelist perspective. For example, BSL performer doesn't need to be on a separate screen/box on the side, but can be inte

reached 65k audiences from 92 countries. Audience stats:

We keep coming back to how do we converge and bring together generations. This was able to do that.

Younger audiences absolutely claim interactivity unconditionally but for older audience, that needed care and invitation.

With our research partners, needed to think about: a) what the audience needs were, and b) What does meaningful togetherness entail

Rather than make creative assumptions about what would land with the audience, used research.

In cross-discipline collaboration, need to really think about and be aware of language and how it means different things to different people. 'meaningful' means differen things to a theatre-maker vs a technology partner, for example.

What 'meaningful' means

What 'immersive' means

This time, needed to conside the entire audience experience.

We made a whole website for people to experience this in. Not just a youtube link that you were sent. 

Also designed a customer care plan.

But in future "There's going to be a point when some of this distribution and infrastructure we won't need to make" all of that themselves. 

[Accessibility] is something that is still isn't right and still isn't working enough in how we build digital works and performances. We're still really led by the technology.

Some of the least technologically advanced work was the most exciting for audiences. There was a ticker that showed how long until the show began and people really took to that as it created a sense of anticipation for them.

"We are no longer the people that you come to, as cultural practictioners. We come to your home"

As important as the performance was, what we had to build was the ritual around it. 

We're still in broadcast mode. next step, is how we get audience to connect to each other.

Traditional forms have all these sets of assumptions and what's exciting with these new digital forms is that when you break those assumptions, you let the audience back in.
