## Design & Data

_What does a data expert see when they look at a design problem? This panel will immerse us in the practices of two data experts, both of whom have collaborated with ethnographers, as they navigate through design challenges in different ways. Chair Jeanette Blomberg will draw the panelists and audience into conversation about synergies and challenges for interdisciplinary design collaborations._

### Thomas Y Lee

Introducing innovation and product design as a process

Whether it's design thinking, product design or hypotehsis dirven devleopment, at a high level the process is fundamentally the same.

Rather than thinking of this as a linear or a stage-gate process, in practice it is often circular and contiuous

So, the question becomes - what is the role of data in this cycle?

Data has long had a role but traditionally this is afterwards - A/B testing, pre/post, etc. In all of these different frameworks, data fundamentally answers questions of how many or how much.

Textual/sentiment analysis for example use word baskets, which are ultimately just counting words.

In order to develop an intimate understanding of a problem, we really need to ask uestions about **'why'**

So, the question is:

"How can we apply processes related to data to begin to answer questions about why and how?"

Example / story:

Ace hardware store in SF. goes in and buys gloves, sweep, spray hose and clorox. Soon as I put items on counter, check-out person said: 'oh you're cleaning your compost bin'

_Can we identify customer intent based on items purchased?_

Customers aren't buying a 1/4 inch drill bit, they're intereste din a 1/4 inch hole. But push it further  - they want to hang a picutre/secure bookcase, etc.

Does domain knowledge (recipes or known projects) improve our abaility to identify projects?

going further: 
Does contextual knowledge (customer demographics) improve our ability to identify projects?


Second example/story:
emergency services wait times.
