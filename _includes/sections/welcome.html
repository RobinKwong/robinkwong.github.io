    <p>This is a website about the intersection of journalism and technology &hellip; plus the most important aspect: people.</p>

    <p>I am talking about the people who make their living producing the news at that intersection. Specifically, I am interested in how they organise themselves. I will be using this space to write about how that is changing rapidly. A good place to start would be my post on <a href="/project-managers/">why newsrooms need project managers</a>.</p>

    <p>Who am I? My name is Robin Kwong, and I am Special Projects Editor at the Financial Times. This is my personal website. You can find out more about me below.</p>
