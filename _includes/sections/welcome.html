    <p>This is a website about the intersection of journalism and technology &hellip; plus a third and most imporpant aspect: people.</p>

    <p>I am talking about the people who make their living producing the news, at that intersection. Specifically, I am interested in how they organise themselves and how they are managed. This is a website where I will be writing about just that. A good place to start would be my post on <a href="/project-managers/">why newsrooms need project managers</a>.</p>

    <p>Who am I? My name is Robin Kwong, and I am Special Projects Editor at the Financial Times. You can find out more about me below.</p>
