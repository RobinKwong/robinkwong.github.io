  <div class="section-content body">
    <p>I am Special Projects Editor at the <a href="http://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a>, where I am bringing project management and design thinking into the newsroom.</p>
    <p>I have been a journalist for the last eleven years, most recently as interactive data journalist where I learnt a little bit about how to code and design websites. Before that, I was the tech editor and had also reported from Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>I majored in philosophy as an undergraduate at Yale. My dad still wants me to quit my job and get a PhD. (Hi dad!)
    <p>I will happily talk about: gardening, games (of both the board and the digital varieties), cooking, and Liverpool FC.</p>
    <p>I live with my lovely wife Scarlet and our very spoiled cat, <a href="http://facebook.com/tiny.cat.54">Valentine</a>, in Southeast London.</p>
