I participated in the inaugural Nikkei-FT fellowship programme in San Francisco, from March to May 2017. During the fellowship, I explored:

- How can we create a need for news by igniting curiosity? How can we make the FT a place that sparks new enquiry, instead of one that just answers our readers questions?

- How can journalism encourage exploration, particularly through the use of digital technologies including interactivity and rirtual reality?

- How do we tell stories that create [emotional understanding](/two-types/) and empathy?

- What does it mean for games to be journalism? Is interactive non-fiction an oxymoron?
