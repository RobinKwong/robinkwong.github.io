Three things most people get wrong:

- Full transparency of OKRs in entire company
- more than half of the companyâ€™s objectives need to be coming from the individuals up through the organization
- OKRs are not a performance evaluation tool
	- spending more than a few minutes grading OKRs
- OKRs need to be measurable
