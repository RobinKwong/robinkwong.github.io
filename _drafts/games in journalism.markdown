> People put themselves at a distance from whatever stories we hear, unless extraordinary measures are taken by the storyteller. Our inabilities to conjure the emotional and physical enormities within a news story are ingrained as a defense mechanism, and it’s one we sorely need: it would be difficult to function if we could picture every sick child in an article about disease, or every dead body in a report about war.
>
> Our brains sanitize the input they receive to shield us from this emotional transference. This distance can be injurious in less obvious ways: the more ways in which someone’s life differs from ours, the harder it can be to fully relate when we are faced with that person’s reality. We often hear and mentally acknowledge a person’s story without ever quite fully understanding their circumstances.

<span class="firstLetter">H</span>ow do we make stories that can permeate that protective barrier and prompt people to drop their emotional shields?

The quest for immersive storytelling, for 'really good prose that sucks you in', all constitute "extraordinary measures taken by the storyteller" to bridge that gap.

But there is another way. Bret Victor referred to it in a footnote deep within Magic Ink:

> It must be mentioned that there is a radically alternative approach for information software &mdash; games. Playing is essentially learning through structured manipulation &mdash; exploration and practice instead of pedagogic presentation.

Games have long been recognised as [important learning tools](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972), but, as Mr Victor also noted: "Despite the enormous potential for mainstream software, accidents of history and fashion have relegated games to the entertainment bin, and the stigma of immaturity is tough to overcome."

Cost was also a factor. Even if news organisation were inclined to overcome the "stigma of immaturity", the lack of skills and technology in newsrooms meant that games were an expensive, difficult and inefficient alternative to the traditional article. 

Some of those constraints are starting to ease. Games sit squarely within mainstream culture, and newsrooms have hired developers and digital designers. 

Some of the language of games have already entered mainstream software design through 'gamification'. But to focus only on the techniques that create a steady dopamine drip to keep players hooked, is to lose sight of the much greater potential of games.

Games are important because they create space for empathy. They give permission to their players to reconnect with their sense of curiosity. Together, these two things invite exploration and, if directed towards jouranlism, could entice people to *want* to learn about the world: 

> Ultimately, if anything, a game is a dialogue &mdash; players speak to you in the breaths and pauses between the constraints you’ve created. This collaboration is precisely how something incredibly personal can become resonant and universal; the only way to truly reach out to others is through yourself.

>Games are the ultimate expression of immersive empathy, because systems are the purest way to transfer feelings and mindsets between one person and another.

> Games changes how we see topics, it changes our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves. We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so.
