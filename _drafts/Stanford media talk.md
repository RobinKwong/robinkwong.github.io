Baxter + Montgomery: Relating Dialogues and Dialectics

The thing about relational labour is that sometimes it's pleasurable, but sometimes it's hard work

"people ahve been listeners for a while and then it wasn't unitl the got to know me on Twitter that they boughtmy album"

Intimacy used to be a refuge from public life. After WWII there was an inversion where intimacy was used to achieve things in public spheres.

Music has always been v social. but there's always been a separation (performer v audience) and so there's always the desire to bridge that gap.

Social media comes along and disrupts relational affordances

you get left with these dialectics where people go between Control / Participation
Distance / closeness

accessibility
response length and frequency
shutting down interactions
managing info / topics

 What can we do to help eople flourish as expectataions for their professional replationship become more interpersonal

## Christine Larson

interviewed 100 romance authors

Brenna Aubrey: french teacher. wrote 

120k for three books over two years

what did scholars think digital media would do to labor in the media industries

scholars said digital media make workers less secure (more 'precarious')

for romance writers, this was not true. although was true for other writers

precarity declined on two measures
success related to inclusive network
social tactics can improve security

the real question is not security and autonomy, but how to balance both

we need to measure precarity in terms of moeny and opportunity

writers auhtor's guild median annual income from books - $6250 2009 
$3750 2014

romance writers: "the industry's most innovative participants"
- 

what did 

two booms in romance: 1975 (invention of paperbacks and distribution to drug stores and grocery stores) and 2010 (ebooks and self-publishing + networking strategies)

why?

Romance writers were outsiders


set up their own network:

RWA vs SFFWA

RWA: completed romance manuscript. SFFWA: earn $3k from approved publsiher

rwa 10k members sffwa 1.9k members

rwa always alllowed self-published writers and had gala awards for unpubbed manuscripts

sffwa was closed network

rwa was 'open elite network'. elites (pubbed authors) gave advice to newcomers. but also received knowledge from new comers who were innovating

v low transaction costs of advice flow

median income romance writers; 2.2k from 2009 to 7.8k in 2014

2009: 7 romance subgenres. 

Happy ending...or is it? everyone is v concerned about role of amazon as platform
