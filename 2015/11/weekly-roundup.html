<p>Some interesting conversations going on about the performance costs of relying on frameworks. Worth a read to get a grasp around the effects of using a framework instead of beginning from scratch.</p>

<h3 id="oh-my-zshhttpsgithubcomrobbyrusselloh-my-zsh"><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh-my-zsh</a></h3>
<p>If you work in the command line often throughout your day it is worth investing some time into customizing it to optimize your workflow. The easiest way to do this that I have found is Oh-my-zsh. It is hosted on Github and the instruction work as expected. I also suggest using iTerm2 instead of the default Terminal. More on why in the future.</p>

<p>I love Jekyll and it is exciting to see a new release. There are a few things I would love to see but it is a really great platform for a small personal site with a blog.</p>

<p>I never knew about this CSS feature. I am seeing more and more vertical type on the web and this might be a good solution. It also has pretty good browser compatibility.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t need a little more Bob Ross in their life?</p>

<h3 id="google-musichttpsplaygooglecommusiclisten"><a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen">Google Music</a></h3>
<p>I, like half of the internet was a little disappointed to find out about Rdio shutting its doors. In search of another service to fill its void and reluctant to switch to Spotify I settled upon Google Music. So far I am really happy with that decision.</p>
